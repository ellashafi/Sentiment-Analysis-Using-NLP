0,betterCallSaul,"All you people say ""oh boohoo Jimmy, boohoohoo Jimmy"" as if Jimmy isn't an adult that can make his own choices.

Lemme ask you something. If Jimmy really isn't a terrible person, how come in S6E8, he asks Lalo to send Kim to Gus' house? Gus doesn't like being disturbed during dinner. What if he shoots Kim before she can shoot him? Also, what if Kim crashes her car along the way to Gus' house? Drivers are getting more and more careless these days. Isn't it safer for her to stay in the apartment with Lalo?

This is where the genius of Better Call Saul lies, kids. Gould shows us that deep down, in the moments of highest pressure during which people are exposed for who they are, Jimmy is nothing more than a slimy ambulance-chasing piece of shit who will throw everyone under the bus to get what he wants.

The story itself seems more lowkey and doesn't quite wear its heart on its sleeve like BB. It's more cerebral and less visceral. But at the same time breaking bad overall seems to have more vigor. 

That's just the impression I get. Perhaps it's because Gilligan has learned from his experience directing BB and now knows what to expect, or it's just because the personality difference between Jimmy and Walt?

42,betterCallSaul,"I watched Breaking Bad when it originally aired and re-watched it again recently but had never gotten around to Better call saul.

* I am pleasantly surprised at how much Mike and Gus were in the show. I knew they were in the show but I had no idea they were basically regulars, I thought they were going to be cameos. Imo, this show made both of their characters even better (which is hard to do - usually things like this work the opposite way).
* Nacho is my favorite character (by far). Really wished he survived but I knew he wouldn't be able to since he wasn't in Breaking Bad. Lalo is also an extremely compelling villain, I'm surprised they had room to make Lalo work as another major cartel villain but it worked. As much as a I hated Lalo, he's a complete badass, especially when he took out those guys at the compound.
* I started to really dislike Chuck, but I am conflicted both with how Vince wanted the viewer to feel and how I should feel. In the end, Chuck was right about Jimmy setting him up, Chuck was more moral regarding the law, but he was such an asshole of a Brother. Him trying to dis-bar Jimmy after all Jimmy had done for him (bringing him things to help his 'condition') felt as immoral, if not more, than what Jimmy was doing at the time.
* I started to feel really bad for Howard Hamlin, I don't really think he deserved much of what he got. As soon as we find out he's not behind Saul being blocked from HHM, I liked his character.
* I thought they did the backstory very clean. Nothing really contradicted the main show nor felt squeezed in. The only thing is I wish the transition into Breaking Bad timeline was shown more. We see Kim decides to pack and leave and then we immediately jump into the middle of Breaking Bad. Would have liked to see a complete transition into it.
* I have a crush on Betsy Kettleman
* Found it weird that Lalo was able to fly to Germany and then make his way back into the US. Not only would that be incredibly risky but I would have to think the cops would be all over that. 
* I wasn't a big fan of the adventures Saul had at the end of the show with Carol Burnett and the clothing store theft/cons. Didn't really mind the black and white style but it just wasn't that interesting to me until he gets caught.
* I might be overlooking one of them but I think my favorite episode was the one where Mike and Saul are stranded in the desert.","Just Finished Watching the Series, here are some thoughts/questions"

44,betterCallSaul,"You know how in Better Call Saul, Jimmy McGill eventually changes his name to Saul Goodman? Well, I just realized something that might blow your mind.

""Saul Goodman"" is an anagram for ""Llamo un negro, S."" which translates to ""I called a black man, S."" in Spanish.

Think about it: Saul is always getting himself into trouble and needing to call on his connections to get out of it. What if this anagram is a clue that one of his connections is a black man with the initial ""S""?

Vince Gilligan at his finest! I know this is just a wild theory, but it would explain a lot. And let's be honest, it's not that much crazier than some of the stuff that actually happens on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

72,betterCallSaul,"I'm not sure if I am the only one who feels like this, but rewatching the Kim and Jesse scene in ""Waterworks"" definitely gives off the vibe that it was initially conceptualized to be an ineraction between Kim and Skyler. If you remove some of the Jesse-specific dialogue and shift the time period to during the Breaking Bad Timeline instead of pre-BrBa, this scene definitely would have made sense with Skyler. Don't get me wrong, the scene with Jesse is great, and I like how they use it as a way for Kim to ""pass the torch"" to Jesse - ie. being the next person who will be a figurative martyr for their partner's scandalous behavior. But having the scene with Skyler would have been interesting as it would have shown an extremely similar dynamic of one character passing the torch to another, but in this case it's between the two wives of the lead whose lives are permanently affected by their husband's actions. Assuming what I am saying is true, it's likely that this scene didn't happen the way it was supposed to since Anna Gunn has generally distanced herself from the Breaking Bad fandom due to the hate she got for playing Skyler.

Did Mike expect Jimmy to do a poor job of spying on the money bag?

If no, then why would he send Jimmy? One wouldn't expect someone as prudent as Mike to count on Jimmy for these jobs that requires great care.

JIMMY: still in prison but transferred somewhere much nicer than ADX Montrose. Likely due to good behavior and overcrowding. He‚Äôs helping inmates file appeals and making right with himself. Has maybe even written a book that sold phenomenally well, proceeds going directly to the victims of Walter White. 

KIM: big question here is, did Cheryl (Howard‚Äôs widow) take her to the cleaners in court? If so then maybe Kim would really be struggling and taking on multiple sources of income to barely make ends meet. If Cheryl moved on, then Kim would likely be back in the legal system in Florida - although always a target for cartel members looking to make a name for themselves. She still visits Jimmy and the two have a good relationship. 

HUELL: definitely a celebrity in Louisiana, makes guest appearances on true crime TV shows. 

CLIFF: long since retired from practicing law, maybe even dead at this point.

141,betterCallSaul,"I finished Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and El Camino. Imma rank deez shows and the characters from BCS

Better Call Saul: Funny lawyer man. I liked it better than Breaking Bad. Was never bored. More Mike content
Breaking Bad: Slept thru some of it. Watched it for Mike
El Camino: Badger and Skinny Pete are my two brain cells. It has a bad rating, but I thought it was good :)

BCS CHARACTER RANKINGS:
1. MIKE!! i love Mike. He reminds me of my grandpa and that's dope as fuck. My grandpa is also dead...i just realized this connection now
2. Nacho. Shit was sad dawg. Dude just got caught up in some shit and I feel so bad for his father yo
3. Howard...this one's a little questionable but I liked him. He was loyal to Chuck and that scene where he asked Jimmy if he ever has insomnia?? he just like me fr
4. Kim?? I kinda didn't like her but I like her?? I like how stern and professional she was. I like her voice. She's a very interesting, confusing character. Very cool
5. Saul Goodman. Funny lawyer man. He did a bunch of dumb shit, and it was funny at the time, but then his antics get worse and worse. Also didn't like how he turned those old ladies against their friend. But he redeemed himself, so I guess that's okay.

142,betterCallSaul,"In the last episode, we hear Jimmy telling the court his involvement with Walt's operation, but not Gus'. I thought he was also the lawyer for some of Gus' guys?

My biggest problem with the whole BB universe is that at the end of the day Walt's 'drug empire' lasted a whole quarter. Maybe half a year at best. Not really big fish when you compare it to decades long running Latin American cartels and Italian/Russian mafias. So to devote that many resources just to round up a comparatively small drug operation seems weird to me.",Was Jimmy not involved with Gus' operation? (Spoilers for S6)

Then there's Hamlin, the respectable &amp; caring lawyer who only wanted to help everyone however he could-- yet was harassed in various ways by Jimmy, of which culminated in his professional image being falsely tainted &amp; everyone's memory of him as a suicidal cocaine addict, and was only seeking answers when he was murdered simply for being in Jimmy's apartment.

158,betterCallSaul,"i‚Äôm in the middle of a BCS rewatch at the moment (currently around Fifi/Nailed as we speak) and remembered something about Saul Gone, and Jimmy‚Äôs longing for a ‚Äútime machine‚Äù. At the end of Chuck and Jimmy‚Äôs final scene the camera pans down from Chuck to H.G Wells‚Äô Time Machine and the shot is lit so that the book is (pretty much) the only object in colour as the rest of the frame is grey. I see this as a metaphor for the show as a whole. The ‚ÄòBook of Regrets‚Äô IS Better Call Saul, it‚Äôs the story. Most of BCS is in colour with the (bleak) future in greyscale like the book is in colour here as everything else is grey.

Chuck and Jimmy",what do I have to do to prove it to you?
173,betterCallSaul,"First, I am delighted that the BCS cast met together for probably the last time at the SAGawards. I have been thinking about this for a while after I finished watching BCS. I have a great admiration for Vince and Peter for bringing such a great show to television.  It must feel great to create a universe that will forever exist in the popular culture ( For lacl of a better term). Imagine creating such a universe of interdependence and with its own ecosystem that satisfies itself but also avail the human problems and conflicts. I have always thought that if you create a universe in a TV show, at the ending of the TV show the said universe will continue existing in the back of our heads somehow. 
I did not feel like that with Breaking Bad because it looked like it ended after Walter's demise , the death of the gang,  Lydia's poisoning,  Mike's death earlier and Gus' death as well.
BCS felt like new characters could always spring up from Albuquerque and the border to continue the universe because it didn't seem like it was truly dead.
If you are keenly observing the universe there is a large possibility that we might get another Saul in 20 years. Sounds absurd but I think a universe is never truly dead. 
New Saul's, Lalos ,Walters ,Maries, Skylers,Kims, Howards and Chucks will come up and keep things.
I mean it is my imagination but deep down I know I know. 
I once believed alot of things could make me happy but now I have a thought that begs to differ. 
I have a dream to create my own universe and be able to share it with people and talk about my universe all day long.
I believe this could really make me very happy and satisfied. 
May that dream come true!",Better Call Saul

I know soyboy BCS fans will come at me saying we wouldn't have gotten Jimmy walking through the desert without him, but he already walked through the desert in S1 and that was way better because he didn't make such a big fucking deal about it. I can't believe they retconned Jimmy for S5E8 to have the ""victim mentality"" of this soyboy generation. My walk to school was longer and hotter than that shit.

Getting back to Lalo, what was the point of bringing him in if he was just gonna do nothing and go back to Mexico anyways?",Do you agree that the Lalo plotline is filler?
187,betterCallSaul,"I'm currently on S6E6 and I don't understand why we keep following this guy around. I understand that he's hot, but he just asked Saul for legal services once. I know people will say Saul wouldn't have gone through the desert if not for Lalo, but he already went through the desert to find the Kettlemans in S1, and that was way better because he didn't get overdramatic like he does in S5. This soyboy generation is all about having a ""victim mentality"" to everything. Maybe that's why they retconned him to be so weak in the S5 desert episode.

Getting back to Lalo, why exactly are you soyboys putting him in the show? What, because he's hot? Or is it because of diversity? Have you all gotten so woke that you now need to have minorities in the show even if they literally do nothing for the plot? What's he gonna do next, shoot Howard? Because Howard is white and this woke generation hates that? If he shoots Howard, who worked hard to earn his money while Jimmy and Kim try to steal it, in the next episode, I'm officially cancelling my AMC+ subscription.

This is like Black Widow where Natasha's name is on the movie but Florence Pugh ends up taking all the runtime, except instead of Florence Pugh it's this crazy person.

189,betterCallSaul,"Walter White is:

* **Envious**, like Charles McGill. Walter White remained in the methamphetamine business even after he made the necessary 737K dollars because of envy for Gretchen and Elliot Schwartz; he wanted to be just as successful as them even if that involved synthesizing a dangerous drug. This explains why he refused Gretchen and Elliot's money; he could never see himself as dependent upon someone else. This explains why it took song long for him to quit the methamphetamine business; he wanted to be more successful than Gretchen and Elliot Schwartz. In the same way, Charles McGill constantly sabotaged James McGill because of his envy; he always believed himself to be superior to James McGill and could not stand James' success. This explains why he convinced Howard Hamlin to deny James McGill a job at HHM; he could not stand his brother working at a prestigious law firm. This explains why he entrapped James McGill into secretly confessing to falsifying important Mesa Verde documents; he wanted his brother to fail as a lawyer. James McGill certainly had his fair share of bad experiences with the envious Charles McGill.
* **A dangerous drug lord**, like Eduardo Salamanca. This is the most obvious similarity between the two. Both Walter White and Eduardo Salamanca were dangerous, high-ranking drug lords. When Walter White kidnaps Saul Goodman in BB2x8, he is instantly reminded of Eduardo Salamanca in BCS6x8; in both episodes, he shouts ""it wasn't me; it was Ignacio"". Both Walter White and Eduardo Salamanca kidnapped lawyers to further their interests. Both Walter White and Eduardo Salamanca harmed innocent people to further their interests; Walter poisoned Brock, and Eduardo killed his body look-alike. Moreover, both getting involved with Walter White and Eduardo Salamanca were double-edged swords. Walter White and Eduardo Salamanca were very profitable for Saul Goodman, and defending Eduardo Salamanca (as Jorge de Guzman) brought new clients; however, his involvement in Walter White's drug empire ultimately led to his downfall, and his involvement with Eduardo Salamanca tarnished his reputation among the Albuquerque legal community. James McGill/Saul Goodman certainly had his fair share of bad experiences with the dangerous drug lord Eduardo Salamanca.
* **Unpredictable**, like Tuco Salamanca. Walter White was a very reckless drug kingpin who often performed crazy acts, such as blowing up Tuco Salamanca's headquarters. He recklessly decided that it was worth killing two drug dealers and risk the integrity of Gustavo Fring's drug empire to save Jesse Pinkman, a ""contemptible junkie"" in the words of Gustavo Fring (to which Walter agrees).  His actions, especially the murders of Gale Boetticher, Gustavo Fring, and the ten men in jail, attracted DEA attention; ASAC Henry Schrader discovered Walter White was Heisenberg by reading a book in his bathroom. Walter White's reckless lack of foresight caused Henry Schrader's death, which caused both Walter and Saul to flee Albuquerque. Similarly, Tuco Salamanca's reckless behavior was very prominent throughout both shows. In front of James McGill, he recklessly threatened to kill two skaters. He recklessly assaulted Michael Ehrmantraut. He recklessly killed No-Doze and Gonzo, which attracted APD and DEA attention. James McGill had a very bad encounter with the reckless Tuco Salamanca.

The fact that Saul Goodman aided Walter White, an amalgamation of the worst traits of Charles McGill, Eduardo Salamanca, and Tuco Salamanca, shows how different he was under ""Saul Goodman"" than he was under ""James McGill"". James McGill would have never aided someone like Walter White, someone who reminds him of three of his most hated people (Charles, Eduardo, and Tuco), but Saul Goodman did. James McGill would have never intentionally hurt people to the scale Saul Goodman would. Charles McGill's last words to James were the worst things he could have said, for they sent James McGill on a very rapid, destructive path into becoming Saul Goodman.",Walter White was EVERYTHING James McGill would have hated.

Chuck is a horrible person, but kind of an incomplete character. There‚Äôs an argument to be made that every time Jimmy slips, his older brother Chuck is to blame.

Am I missing something here?",Does Chuck have a single redeeming quality?
196,betterCallSaul,,"Had a ""better call saul"" moment today."

At first I couldn't quite see what Jimmy saw in her, but as time went on I realised that she was just as damaged as Jimmy, it's just that her damage manifested in a different way.

I don't know why, but while I found Cliff to be an OK guy, there was just something about him that annoyed me slightly. Maybe the slightly stiff manner, maybe the fact that he didn't seem to have a lot of empathy for other people. Sure, he seemed to care about Howard when he thought Howard was struggling with a drug problem, but there was just something about him that made him a little unlikeable. He seemed to be the sort of guy that only displayed concern when he thought it was socially necessary to do so.",Which character grew on you the most and which character did you end up disliking the most?

199,betterCallSaul,"I just finished season 2, and I'm dying to know what the opinions of the fanbase are on this topic without hearing spoilers. I don't have a clue how others felt about it, but when Jimmy did that backstabbing trick to Chuck for the sake of Kim's business, I really lost a lot of respect for him. Yes, I realize that he wasn't very morally upstanding to begin with, but he destroyed Chuck's perfect track record just for the sake of getting a big business opportunity for his girlfriend. I think it's actually insulting to Kim that he continuously does this kind of thing for her, trying to help her when she is fully capable of handling herself (which is what she is trying to do anyway).

Anyway, my point is that I've actually been kinda rooting for Chuck. I'm seeing similarities between the way that Jimmy lies and manipulates people and the way that Walter did in Breaking Bad. I still like Jimmy a lot, but not when he's ruining innocent people's lives. I'd love to hear the perspective of you guys, especially the ones who supported Jimmy in this arc.",Jimmy vs Chuck discussion (S2)

202,betterCallSaul,"I understand they probably needed to end the show/universe without making it too stale, and 6 seasons was just the right length. However, I think a brilliant guy like Vince Gilligan giving BCS a romance novel ""I love you so much Kim that I would go to prison for life"" was not the right move.

In the series, we see how he's Jimmy and Saul, two sides of the same coin etc. And I understand at the ending, they were trying to impress upon us that he gave up the Saul life and wants to show this to Kim, hence the courtroom scene. Speaking of Kim, he wasn't trying to ""save"" her either. She was gonna be boned by Howard's wife in a civil suit regardless.

But he was what, 52 at the end of BCS? He'd get out in 7 years from that deal, and he threw it all away. Yes, he wants to atone for what he did. But 20+ years in prison is a long ass time, he didn't deserve life in the joint as he was coerced by a man who could kill you IN prison. 

There would be plenty of time for soul searching after his release. Hell, go to the families of everyone affected and talk to them, see their point of view etc. and now Jimmy is once again a millionaire after selling his huge hit of a novel.","Why didn't Saul do his 7 years first, and then start atoning when he's a free man?"

I thought about this less watching Breaking Bad then I did watching Better Call Saul because we learn just how difficult digging out the space to construct the lab was (as opposed to it just being built in an existing basement) but really many of the same issues apply throughout. It just doesn‚Äôt seem like ther are enough advantages to make it really worth the dangers and downsides ‚Äî though obviously it opens up for many plot complications.

&amp;#x200B;

I made similar threads for seasons 1 and 2.

&amp;#x200B;

 From 3x09 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* Vince Gilligan's girlfriend Holly after watching 3x09:¬†  
 

On Kim's car accident:¬† ""You're not going to kill her, are you?¬† Because if you do, I'll murder you all.""  
 

\* During the scene when the unmanned car is going towards the pump  jacks, and Kim has to get in the car and stop it, for the most part,  Seehorn did that stunt by herself.  
 

Only the last part, where Kim jumps in the moving car, was a stunt woman used.  
 

\* The pump jacks were not real.¬† They were visual effects from the art  department, SFX (sound) department, and VFX (visual) department.  
 

They built something with a motor and rope that moved up and down.  
 

\* Seehorn had to carefully play the scene where she was pushing the car,  and she fell on her butt.¬† She had to try and NOT make falling on her  butt, funny.  
 

It was supposed to be awkward and frustrating.  
 

They used a pad, for the fall, every few takes.  
 

\* Vince Gilligan tells a story about David Bowie.¬† He walked right in the middle of New York City, and no one noticed him.  
 

He was with a journalist.¬† The journalist asked, why is no one noticing you?  
 

Bowie said, ""because I don't have IT turned on.""  
 

Bowie then started making subtle eye contact with people, and people then noticed him.  
 

This story was supposed to relate to what makes something funny, vs. not funny.  
 

\* Vince Gilligan says the worst thing Jimmy has ever done is the scam on Ms. Landry. 	

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From 3x10 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* Odenkirk hadn't had a Doritos in 30 years, because of how chemically produced they are.  
 

Jimmy had a scene where he ate Doritos, with Kim, at the condo.¬† That's  when Kim tells him to do ""cheese on cheese"", and dip the Doritos in  cheese sauce.  
 

When he put one in his mouth, Odenkirk said ""Oh my god!"" at how good they were, and ate 20.  
 

\* On Bob Odenkirk doing Mr. Show:  
 

They did not use cue cards for that.  
 

They would do one dress rehearsal.¬† Then the version filmed in front of the audience.  
 

6/10 times, the first take of the second show was the best one.  
 

\* The actress that played Erin appeared on Mr. Show, when she was 4 years old.  
 

\* Sometimes, when these Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul shows are  dubbed internationally, the international company gets the same actors  that played Tuco, etc. for the lines.  
 

When they don't, Odenkirk thinks it's funny to see those actors  interpretations of various lines.¬† Sometimes they are louder, etc.  
 

\* Vince Gilligan:¬† Two things that never travel globally are baseball  movies and TV shows, and legal shows, because legal systems are  different in every country.  
 

However, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul seem to not have that problem.  
 

Jimmy is recognizable as a lawyer.  
 

And, they've seen so much American culture overseas that they understand Jimmy's place in the legal system.  
 

\* They are pondering whether during the Breaking Bad timeline, maybe Kim  and Jimmy live in Santa Fe.¬† And during the day, Jimmy goes to  Albuquerque and is a sleazeball.  
 

And at night, he's a good husband and father to two kids.  
 

And that he literally changes his persona driving back home every  night.¬† He changes his clothes, changes his personality, on the way  home.  
 

\* For this episode, they actually wrote the teaser after writing the  rest of the episode.¬† They didn't know what they wanted to do at first.  
 

Then they thought of the flashback idea.  
 

\* They are impressed with the two kids who play Chuck and Jimmy.¬† They  think the older one studied Michael McKean well, as he has his  mannerisms down cold.  
 

And, they are impressed that the younger one NEVER looked at the  camera.¬† They thought it would be awkward for him, having a camera so  close to his face.¬† But the young actor never even paid attention to it,  and just did his scene.  
 

\* Vince Gilligan didn't know there was a baseball bat in the tent.¬† This  would be the same bat adult Chuck would use later in the episode on the  electric meter at the house.  
 

\* They had never intended for the book ""The Adventures Of Mabel"" to be  anything more than a throwaway line in 3x01.¬† And for it to be a nod to  Gilligan's mom, since she would read it to Vince and his brother  Patrick.  
 

So the fact that it's in the 3x10 teaser, was completely unplanned.¬†  First they had to think of what to do for the teaser, as they didn't  originally have anything when they wrote the script.¬† Then they decided  to use the book.  
 

\* The book is visible in the last scene of the episode.  
 

\* They love the homemade look of the tent, and of young Chuck and Jimmy camping in the yard.  
 

\* This teaser is the first time, between both shows, that a ""one-er"" was  used in a teaser.¬† (A single uninterrupted shot for the whole teaser.)  
 

\* The intention behind the teaser was to show how the rivalry between  the brothers was formed.¬† They did not want it to come off as maudlin.  
 

\* Gilligan says this is the beauty of television, as opposed to movies.¬† You can make up things as you go along.  
 

\* They would have put in a knockoff Donald Duck night light in the tent,  if they could have found something like it.¬† This was referenced in  3x01.  
 

\* They had to get special permission to not put credits during Act 1 of  Breaking Bad, in episode 5x14.¬† It just felt horribly wrong to put  credits there.  
 

They need a lot of waivers to allow the credits to be moved.  
 

Every network, every studio has their own protocol, on how the credits should be displayed, that they don't want broken.  
 

\* They were not able to get permission to show a clip of To Kill A  Mockingbird.¬† They could not get permission from Gregory Peck's estate.¬†  
 

They wanted Jimmy to come into the room while Kim was watching the movie, and for their dialogue to occur over the movie.  
 

\* Blockbuster wasn't real, it was a set.  
 

\* The art department made hundreds of movie covers.  
 

\* If a movie cover has an actor's picture, they needed to get clearance.¬† For example, Heath Ledger in ""A Night's Tale"".  
 

\* They point out that Kim didn't say ""I crashed the car"", she said ""I  crossed three lanes of traffic.""¬† They wanted to show that she was  thinking of others.¬† And she realizes she could have killed someone.  
 

\* There's a red bell on the counter of the upholstery shop.¬† Symbolic of future Hector's bell.  
 

\* The actor that plays Nacho's dad, was really only cast for one scene in season 2.¬† They had no plans for him beyond that.  
 

They liked the actor so much, that they brought his character back.  
 

\* They used the Panasonic Varicam again, for the night scenes out on the street, with the cartel.¬†  
 

That camera is so sensitive to light, that the little red tally light on  the camera, that tells the actors that the camera is live, was lighting  up the actors faces.¬† They noticed something red on the faces of the  actors, and it was coming from the tally light.  
 

\* Mike is getting swallowed up in a corporate cartel world.¬† It's a contract that never expires.  
 

\* They love the scene when Howard pays off Chuck.  
 

\* Gus does not want anyone else to kill Hector, because they're not doing it right.  
 

\* Michael Mando is not a native Spanish speaker.¬† They are impressed with how fluent he sounds, in the scenes with Nacho's dad.  
 

\* Bonnie Bartlett is one of the actresses that plays Irene's friends.¬† She's won two Emmys for St. Elsewhere.",Season 3 Insiders Podcast Notes: 3x09 - 3x10.
255,betterCallSaul,"During the original broadcast, I  didn't discover the Insiders Podcast  until season 5.  I'm doing a  rewatch now, and listening to the Insiders  Podcast after every episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made similar threads for seasons 1 and 2.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 3x07 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* They got 1,200 auditions for the parks department supervisor.  
 

They go through each one.  
 

\* The actor for the parks department supervisor had previously auditioned for something in 3x06. He didn't get it.  
 

They thought of him later for the parks department supervisor in 3x07.  
 

\* The underwear that Jimmy picks up, when cleaning the freeway  underpass, is Jonathan Banks' underwear. They asked him to give them his  underwear, from his trailer.  
 

\* They use a drone for one of the shots here.  
 

\* When Michael Mando would audition for stuff earlier in his career, he  would take the overnight 12 hour bus from Montreal to Toronto; shower at  the YMCA; put on a fake tattoo or something for his character, then go  to his audition.  
 

\* They didn't intentionally write another part for Pryce. They just  wrote a part for Nacho to get pills from someone. Then they realized  they already had a character with a background in pharmaceuticals, in  Pryce. So they brought him back.  
 

\* The scene with Jimmy and Kim going back to the bar, was originally  supposed to be by the pool, where they shared their kiss in 2x01.  However, it was being filmed in winter, where it was cold. So they moved  it indoors.  
 

\* When that scene was written, the intent was supposed to be Jimmy trying to rekindle the spark with Kim.  
 

However, the way Odenkirk played it, it was about his rage with Chuck.  
 

\* When Jimmy proposes a scam at the bar, Jimmy really pushes for this  one, and Kim gets a glimpse as to who he could become. She then says  ""we're not really going to do it, right? We're just talking.""  
 

\* Michael Mando compliments how the show doesn't overdo sound. They use it scarcely. But when they use it, it's impactful.  
 

For example, when Kim slams a book on Paige's table, it rattles the windows.  
 

Other times, this show uses silence well.  
 

\* They used a drone shot, when looking down on the interstate. 	 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 3x08 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* Patrick Fabian ran a triathlon for the Childrens' Hospital L.A., on the day of the Emmys.  
 

He said that was such a complete day in his life.¬†  
 

He started off the day at Zuma Beach.¬† Then at 2pm, his hair and makeup  people make him look good so he could talk about Better Call Saul at the  Emmys.  
 

\* He said Jon Cryer won the Emmys, then hosted the thing.¬† I have no  idea what he's talking about, since Cryer hadn't won an Emmy since 2012:  
 

[https://www.emmys.com/bios/jon-cryer](https://www.emmys.com/bios/jon-cryer)  
 

And it was the 2016 Emmys that Fabian was talking about:  
 

[https://patrickfabian.com/news/2016/09/](https://patrickfabian.com/news/2016/09/)  
 

Maybe he means Cryer hosted an after party?¬† I don't know.  
 

\* When Bryan Cranston shaved his head during season 1 of Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan also did, in solidarity.  
 

Gilligan is jealous that Cranston grew his hair back so quickly, while Gilligan didn't.  
 

\* Chuck naming colors when he's going through the grocery store, is a form of anxiety redirection.  
 

\* Howard, when he sees Kim at the restaurant in front of Mesa Verde, and  makes the comment that she used to be in doc review, is a rare example  of him losing his cool.  
 

Same when they are out in front of the valet parking lot, and he rips up her check.  
 

\* Bob Odenkirk, on his confrontation with the parks rec manager, where he tells the park recs manager he'll sue him:  
 

Jimmy:¬† He manipulates other people too, and that's what makes him a good lawyer.  
 

He'll hurt people too, but be oblivious to the collateral damage, or not want to look at it.  
 

Saul:¬† He will do this, but not care about the collateral damage.¬† He's aware of the damage.  
 

It's not about the name between the characters, it's the self-awareness  that people get hurt in his schemes.¬† Saul doesn't care, and is  mercenary.  
 

That's the journey I see.  
 

Vince Gillian:¬† Taking the wrong lessons in life.  
 

\* This is the first episode Heather Marion has solo written.¬† She says it's much harder than co-writing.¬† A lot more work.  
 

She grew up in a family of morticians, with her dad, uncle, and grandfather.  
 

\* When Mike finds the dead body in the desert, Heather says was a real  dead person, based on her real life experiences being around dead  bodies.  
 

\* They used a stunt actor for some of the digging scenes.  
 

\* Jimmy's slipping on the drumstick in the ABQ In Tune store, was partly  done with a stunt double.¬† It's similar to Bryan Cranston's slip in the  Breaking Bad episode ""Fly"".  
 

They used the same type of computerized effects with the slip, and with the stunt double.",Season 3 Insiders Podcast Notes: 3x07 - 3x08.
256,betterCallSaul,"During the original broadcast, I  didn't discover the Insiders Podcast  until season 5.  I'm doing a  rewatch now, and listening to the Insiders  Podcast after every episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made similar threads for seasons 1 and 2.

&amp;#x200B;

From the 3x05 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* The actor that played the prosecutor originally tried out for Lyle.¬† They thought he was too commandeering for that role.  
 

When the role of the prosecutor came up, he was a better fit.  
 

\* They watched 6 hours of a real disbarment hearing to find out how one goes.¬† The defendant did not win her case.  
 

\* There's actually no defense attorneys in a disbarment hearing.  
 

\* They took liberties with the hearing to make it more dramatic.  
 

For example, during a real cross-examination, the answers are supposed to be ""yes"" or ""no"".  
 

However, it was more dramatic if they asked Howard which partner kept  Jimmy from getting the job at HHM, and Howard said ""Chuck"".  
 

\* There is an unmentioned subtext of Kim also battling Howard, when she cross-examines Howard.  
 

\* Even though Odenkirk doesn't say much for most of this episode, they  like how he never stops acting.¬† Anytime they cut to him, he's always  doing something, so you can read his mind.  
 

\* The battery moment is supposed to be like the strawberries moment in ""The Caine Mutiny"".  
 

\* They predict Rebecca had divorced Chuck by 1998.¬† That's why she doesn't know about Chuck's condition.  
 

In 1x08, he's also not wearing his wedding ring, and around electricity, in the 1x08 teaser.  
 

\* During the scene where Chuck is losing it, in the kitchen, during the  teaser, they used a 35mm film camera, and hand cranked it backwards, to  create double and triple exposures.¬† That's how they created the jitter  effect.  
 

This is the first time on Better Call Saul that they used a film camera.  
 

\* They used the Panasonic Varicam during the teaser, with the candlelight dinner.  
 

The amount of light provided by the candles, was measured in a unit called foot candles.¬† It was between 1 - 2 foot candles.  
 

\* Every director comes up with a different way to express Chuck's  condition.¬† For example, Chuck getting the newspaper in season 1, is  different than the dinner scene in this episode.  
 

\* This episode is dedicated to Gordon Smith's mom, who passed away. 	

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 3x06 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* They mention again that they're having a hard time with the running  time this season.¬† Things are turning out longer than they predict.  
 

In season 1, they actually had a few episodes that were shorter than they expected.  
 

For this season, they think maybe the issue is that Odenkirk talks quickly.¬† But, he doesn't do much talking this season.  
 

The other actors talk more.  
 

Plus, as they're getting more into the cartel world, those scenes are just slower and methodical.  
 

\* The actress that plays Lydia flew from Scotland, for her scene.¬† She  got on a plane within 4 hours of them calling her and asking her to play  her part.  
 

\* They like how Nacho is so deliberate and methodical with his actions.¬†  Whether it's beating up Krazy-8, or concealing one of Hector's dropped  pills, he's always observing and thinking something.  
 

\* Odenkirk was happy to do the phone call montage where he calls his  clients to tell him he won't be practicing law for a year.¬† He hasn't  gotten a chance to do something funny this scene.  
 

And he got to adlib a few parts.¬† The extended version is on the Blu Ray.  
 

It took 8 hours to film the montage, and that was considered ""efficient"".  
 

\* They say Howard is a good friend, to go over to Chuck's.¬† The 36 year old bottle of Macallan from 1966 isn't real.  
 

They couldn't easily find it, so they constructed the box that Macallan  comes in, to make it look like the real box.¬† And they put a label on an  old bottle.  
 

They wanted it to look as real as possible.  
 

\* That's not real scotch, it's tea.¬† They like the scene where he sniffs the ""scotch"".  
 

\* They think it's funny that the boom mic is sticking out of Jimmy's car.  
 

\* They think Jimmy's chemistry with the film crew gets better and better, each time he's with them.  
 

\* The Suzuki Esteem is parked next to a Jack In The Box. They had to  change the logo on the building, digitally, so it was the old logo.    
 

\* Chuck's walk around town was shot at 20,000 ISO.  
 

At first, it looked normal, and not blown out, like it was supposed to.  
 

They had to talk to some of the other show staff, who had missed the  note that it was supposed to look blown out, and were correcting it.  
 

This reminds them of the Star Trek story.¬† The one with William Shatner and Roddenberry.  
 

There was supposed to be a green alien.¬† They put on green makeup.¬† But  every time they went to the screening room, she looked normal.  
 

They put on even more green makeup¬† Same thing.  
 

The Color Timer person, who makes sure the color looks consistent, was  going ""OMG!¬† This woman looks green!"" and was correcting it.  
 

They had to tell him, no, it's supposed to look like that.  
 

The same thing was happening to them on this Better Call Saul episode.¬†  Some other show staff was correcting the color, to make it look normal.  
 

\* The director of this episode, Keith Gordon, they know him as an actor from a bunch of stuff.  
 

\* They are not sure whether Kim likes the ""Saul Goodman"" character on  the commercial that is selling filming and advertisement services.¬† They  can't tell.  
 

They know she liked the Jimmy who did cons in season 2.¬† But not sure about this one.",Season 3 Insiders Podcast Notes: 3x05 - 3x06.
257,betterCallSaul,"During the original broadcast, I  didn't discover the Insiders Podcast  until season 5.  I'm doing a  rewatch now, and listening to the Insiders  Podcast after every episode. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made similar threads for seasons 1 and 2.

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 3x03 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* Gilligan doesn't really enforce a certain look for the show.¬† There's  some things they generally do, but all the rules are breakable.¬† What's  important is telling the story.  
 

\* Kim and Jimmy's law offices are not a real location anymore.¬† Someone leased the building.  
 

So it's now in a set, that they had to create, to look like the real location.  
 

\* Filming the Jimmy and Kim scene at the end was arguably harder than the action scenes.¬† Because it's dark.  
 

\* When thinking of ways of how Mike would get revenge, the idea of  sprinkling meth came up early.¬† Then they had to figure out how to  execute it.  
 

They thought what if Mike or someone Mike paid, sold food, at the border.¬† But that would involve other people again.  
 

Then they thought of a BB gun.  
 

Or streamers above a road.  
 

Then it came to shoes, because everyone has seen shoes hanging from a powerline.  
 

\* They tested out shooting meth from shoes, using a gun, to see if it was really realistic.¬† It was.  
 

\* They had to use 3 different police dogs before they found the right one.¬† First they tried a cadaver sniffing dog.  
 

Also, the dog handlers have a real heroin pheromone, that they use for  the dogs.¬† They don't want the dog to go on for too long without finding  something, so they want to reward the dog.  
 

They don't want the dog to get discouraged.  
 

So they will manually give off that scent, so the dog can find something, if they think the dog has gone on too long.  
 

\* It was realistic to have the dog sit, instead of bark.¬† Because if the dog starts barking, then the criminals will run away.  
 

But if the dog sits, when the dog finds something, then the criminals are more unaware.  
 

\* They love Peter Diseth, who plays Bill Oakley.¬† They say he's the most  comic relief person in the episode, and that's saying something in a  show with Odenkirk.  
 

They also say how professional he is.¬† He's a local actor in  Albuquerque.¬† But when he decides how to do a take, he commits to it.  
 

So he'll open a bag of chips, or hold fries, the same way, every time.¬†  
 

That's important, because when editing, if something is different, then  the editors might not always use the best takes, as they might be going  more for what is the most consistent, with the placement of items, or  mannerisms, in the scene.  
 

\* These actors are so prepared, that Gilligan once visited Odenkirk, and  he saw the other actors at his place, rehearing things one week ahead  of time. 	 

&amp;#x200B;

 \* Blocking is something that's not taught in film school.¬† But it's one of the most important things.  
 

Blocking means figuring out the actors movements and body positions, as  well as camera position and lighting position, beforehand.  
 

If it's blocked wrong, then the scene can't always be fixed in editing.  
 

From the 3x04 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* Don Eladio's speedo was custom built.¬† It's less skimpier than normal ones.  
 

His swimming in the pool, is also supposed to mirror the last shot of him in Breaking Bad.  
 

\* The Sabrosita bobble head was also see in 2x09, on the dashboard of the truck driver.  
 

\* They built a set for the PPD (pre-prosecution diversion) meeting.¬†  However, they had to ""shitify"" it, so they had to discolor some of the  paint, and make the shades crooked.  
 

They were impressed the actress who plays DA Hays could mesh with the  regular cast (Fabian, Odenkirk, Seehorn, McKean) so flawlessly.¬† All the  others have done scenes together for years.  
 

Yet she came in and fit right in.  
 

\* When Jimmy is apologizing, and Chuck slumps, that wasn't written in  the script, nor did the director tell him to do that.¬† He just did it.  
 

Between that, and other touches the other actors had, they are impressed how these actors portray these scenes.  
 

\* This episode had the most deleted content for the season.¬† They are  having a hard time with running time for this show, a lot more so than  on Breaking Bad.  
 

A deleted scene is Hector bothering the customers at Los Pollos.¬† (It's  on the Blu Ray).¬† He goes up to several of them and messes with them.  
 

\* There's another deleted scene where Victor tells Gus that Mike refused  the money.¬† You can see a box cutter in that scene.¬† This is also on  the Blu Ray.  
 

\* Mark Margolis had quit smoking.¬† They felt bad that they asked him to smoke.¬†  
 

They can't digitally add smoke.¬† They say smoke and fire look really bad, if digitally added.  
 

\* Chuck's house has windows everywhere necessary, so they can add light into the house that way.  
 

\* There was an off-screen person who would give a cue to Mike, when he  was fixing Chuck's door, so Mike would know when to pull the trigger on  the drill.  
 

\* The fire station where Gus is donating money is the same one where Walt dropped off Holly in Breaking Bad.  
 

\* When Gus is meeting Mike, to ask him why he turned down the money,  there was originally supposed to be underscore music at the beginning of  the scene.  
 

Later, they moved it so that it started when Gus said to Mike that maybe  he would work for him in the future.¬† It changed the whole tone of the  scene, and they liked it better.",Season 3 Insiders Podcast Notes: 3x03 - 3x04.
258,betterCallSaul,"Was it the divorce from Rebecca or Jimmy becoming a lawyer?  I can't totally place the timeline to figure out what happened first.  I always felt the scenes with Rebecca set the stage for her leaving him because as well as they got along, he idealized her and considered themselves the perfect intellectual couple, but she saw cracks in him that caused her to leave, and ultimately caused him to spiral out of mental control.  Jimmy just exacerbated it.  Jimmy knew that and exploited it in the end.",Who really caused Chuck's mental illness? Rebecca or Jimmy?
259,betterCallSaul,[removed],Were both Daniel and Luis Moncada in prison?
260,betterCallSaul,"Look, Vince is clearly an all-star director/producer, and the fact he does TV is basically moot in the modern era if you wanted to discredit his credentials.

We consistently see phenomenal performances from his actors. Giancarlo Esposito has used this fame to become the stereotypical ""intelligent bad guy"" in other series... Like, he's the default if they can't think of anything else, and it's not like he's cheap. Bryan Cranston is now regarded as a top tier actor for his demographic, which he should be. Aaron Paul is in a similar category.

What I think is weird, is that we haven't seen the same adoption of actors in BCS, despite equally good and arguably better performances. Like, Anna Gunn I'd put on the same tier as Tilda fucking Swinton in performance. She was straight up unimpeachable. And yet, no major projects have picked her up; idk why she isn't a top-tier candidate for other roles. Like, how are roles in 2023 not ""we can't afford Anna Gunn, who do we get instead?""

Same thing with Michael Mando and Tony Dalton. Like, they were just objectively perfect. Not only was their acting objectively amazing, but they were in-arguably the best spanish-speaking characters in either series, where Don Eladio/Tio/Juan Bolsa/Giancarlo speak in a weird non-native way? Mando has done very little, and Dalton has gone back to Mexican media. How are they not picking and choosing their projects?

I'm just perpetually surprised these actors aren't the talk of the fucking town and involved in everything as an A-list film actor... What's even the bar?","Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Giancarlo Esposito all had their career explode after breaking bad. Why so little for Anna Gunn, Michael Mando, and Tony Dalton?"
261,betterCallSaul,"I just finished season 4 so please no season 5/6 spoilers. 

Why did Gus go to such great lengths to keep their location of the Germans a secret only to let them take R&amp;R in Albuquerque? 

I understand why they maintained such a secret for all of the workers. They wanted to make sure that even if someone confessed they had no real way of finding the actual location of the meth lab. But after the Germans go out for R&amp;R at the strip club, Mike explicitly tells Werner that they are in Albuquerque (he says this when mentioning that Werner should not have talked to the other person in the bar). 

Why do all this just to tell them where they are? They made sure to keep everyone in a windowless building to prevent them from guessing the topography / location. At this point they could‚Äôve just let them live in a building that at least had outdoor access or drive them 10-15 minutes from another building.",Question about the Germans in S04

268,betterCallSaul,"When Jimmy reads Chuck's letter to Kim during 4x03, Jimmy is unmoved.

Kim cries.

She has to leave the room.

&amp;#x200B;

Does she cry because she saw the subtle digs during the undated letter, such as ""nothing made mom happier"", implying Chuck was jealous of the love Jimmy received from mom?  

Or during the line where Chuck says he was proud of Jimmy in the mail room, implying that's the only time Chuck was proud of him?

(The letter could have also been written before Jimmy was a lawyer.)

&amp;#x200B;

Or did she cry because she thought the letter was genuine, and since Kim was an only child, she reflected on the lost and damaged bond between Chuck and Jimmy?

In the next episode, she does suggest to Jimmy that he seek counseling, since it had been two months, and he hadn't found a job yet either.  So in that sense, it appears that she is concerned with Jimmy's cold behavior, starting from when Howard told Jimmy that Chuck committed suicide, to Jimmy's reading of Chuck's letter, aloud.

On the other hand, she also recognized that Howard was trying to unload his guilt onto Jimmy, and that Howard hadn't told Rebecca that Chuck had committed suicide.

So maybe she's crying at how damaged Chuck's death has made Jimmy?

He can't sleep, he's waking up early, he hasn't accepted a job, and he seems to want to deal with his brother as little as possible.","Did Kim cry because she saw the subtle digs from Chuck's letter, or because she thought the letter was heartfelt?"

How would Gus know this?

Mike met with Nacho in 3x07.

Gus doesn't track Nacho until 4x01.

So how would he know that Mike was even aware of what Nacho was doing?  Especially when Mike was seemingly more concerned with embezzling his money through Madrigal Electromotive.

He might be aware that Mike and Nacho knew each other, if he was tracking them as early as 2x09, ""Nailed"".  But even then, that was well before 3x07.  And also well after he stopped tracking Mike.

Over several months there was a big construction site inside the lavanderia. Also the german guys came to work while laundry employees were on site. That means those civilians must have noticed the work. But after the lab was finished, there was no noticeable change to the building.

285,betterCallSaul,"Starting point:
‚Ä¢ Gus Fring's Laundry, Albuquerque, NM

Time: 
12 AM

Conditions:
- Next commercial flight out of North America is in 17 hours and leaves from Denver (Mike knows this and expects you to opt for this).
- No flights leave out of ABQ international airport for the next 24 hours because of a technical glitch with 
- Ed the disappearer isn't available yet.

What I would do:

I would start by getting a cab from the laundry to the bus station, and from there I would pay my cab driver to go buy me a wig and some make-up to mask my identity (somewhere where I can't be seen). I would then stay there until the guy came back, and change into my wig and new identity.

The bus leaves in a few hours, Mike would be dangerously close to discovering my location before I left.

I would then take the bus from ABQ to Denver, and head straight to the airport. Once at the airport, and only then, I would throw away my wig, wash away any make-up and be myself again (the airport is safe with all the security there). At this point, Mike has already discovered that I made my way to the bus station and it's only a matter of time before he discovers the new identity I created from the CCTV footage which you better believe he will access.

At the airport, I would take the first flight out of North America to Europe, and then mission complete.

During the exchange howard projects that the current year would be one of hhm's best years. The line hits differently when you consider that according to the timeline, that scene and the events season 6 episode 9 only occurred less than 3 months apart.",Obscure line that hits differently now (SPOILERS)
300,betterCallSaul,"So in Season 6 Episode 8 ""Point and Shoot"", Lalo takes Gustavo down to the unfinished lab, where it looked like he planned to kill him. Lalo lets Gustavo talk into the camcorder and he completely goes off on all the Salamancas. It is quite the scene. Not to mention the acting is phenomenal on both actor's parts. I was honestly at the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen with Lalo.

However, Lalo says ""big talk. You're done."" And Gustavo promptly responds with ""No. Not yet."" 

I don't like this because it clearly shows that Gustavo possesses psychic abilties, as he clearly is aware that he makes it through this show and into Breaking Bad. I feel like his superpowers should have been expanded on much more, and I think it is a disservice for the fans to only get a tease of it. 

Additionally, I noticed that Lalo was smiling as he was on the ground, bleeding to death after the Gustavo shot him. Now I found this to be unrealistic because I doubt most people would smile like that in such a situation. Therefore, I have concluded that in his last moments, Lalo realized how in love he truly was with Gustavo, and that the whole time it's not that he hated Gus and wanted to kill him, he was just trying to lure him down there to makeout. This also would explain the camcorder, as he wanted to film it. 

Other than that though, solid episode and overall a solid season and ending to a great show. Thoughts?","(Spoilers) This show is obviously amazing, but there's one detail that I think the writers could have executed much better, and I think that it does bring the quality of the show down a bit."

Howard nodded, his heart racing in his chest. He had no idea what was happening or why he was being threatened.  ""I've been hearing a lot about you lately,"" Lalo continued. ""You're a pretty smart guy, Howard. But you're also a liability. And in my line of work, liabilities don't last very long.""  Howard tried to back away, but Lalo's gun followed him.

And if I let someone like you walk around talking about me, it's not good for business.""  Howard's mind raced as he tried to come up with a plan. He knew that he was no match for Lalo, but he also knew that he couldn't just stand there and let himself be killed.  In a split second, Howard lunged forward, knocking Lalo's gun out of his hand. The two men grappled on the floor, each fighting for control. Howard was surprisingly agile and managed to land a few blows on Lalo, but the older man was much stronger and more experienced.  Finally, Lalo gained the upper hand, pinning Howard to the ground. He reached for his gun, intending to finish the job, but Howard managed to grab a nearby lamp and smash it over Lalo's head.  Lalo staggered back, momentarily dazed. Howard scrambled to his feet and made a run for the door. He knew that he had to get out of there before Lalo recovered.  As he ran down the hallway, Howard heard Lalo's footsteps pounding after him. He knew that he was running out of time. Suddenly, he saw a door on his left and darted inside. It was a storage room filled with boxes and junk.  Howard quickly shut the door and pushed a heavy filing cabinet in front of it. He could hear Lalo's footsteps getting closer, but he hoped that the cabinet would buy him some time.  Howard looked around the room, searching for something to defend himself with. He saw a broken piece of wood on the floor and picked it up, holding it like a weapon.  Suddenly, the door burst open, and Lalo stepped inside, his gun in his hand. Howard tensed, ready to fight for his life.  The two men circled each other warily, both knowing that this was a fight to the death. Lalo lunged forward, but Howard sidestepped him and swung the piece of wood at his head. Lalo ducked, narrowly avoiding the blow.  The fight continued for what seemed like hours, each man landing blows and dodging attacks. Finally, Howard saw an opening and took it, landing a powerful punch to Lalo's jaw.  Lalo staggered back, dazed and disoriented. Howard knew that he had to act fast if he

wanted to survive. He lunged forward, knocking Lalo's gun out of his hand and grabbing it himself.

Lalo raised his hands in surrender, knowing that he had been beaten. Howard took a step back, still holding the gun on Lalo.

""I don't know who you are or what you want,"" Howard said, his voice shaking with adrenaline. ""But if you ever come after me again, I'll be ready for you.""

Lalo nodded, his eyes fixed on Howard's gun. Howard backed out of the room, keeping his aim on Lalo until he was out of sight. Then he turned and ran down the hallway, not stopping until he was outside, gasping for breath.

As he stumbled down the street, Howard realized that his life had just changed forever. He had faced down a member of one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in the world and come out alive. He didn't know what the future held, but he knew that he was a survivor.",I made a battle between Lalo and Howard using chat GPT

343,betterCallSaul,"The Irene example is the most obvious one but there are a few more I can think of off the top of my head.

When he's out in the desert with Tuco, they are going to let Jimmy go, but he turns back and continues to try and save the lives of the two skateboarders, a very risky move when dealing with someone like Tuco.

Another one is when he confessed to swapping the Sandpiper numbers to make Chuck feel better, Jimmy had to know that would be a risky thing to outright admit to Chuck. 

Another one is when he warns the Kettlemans while trying to cover up his voice, but he ends up ditching that attempt and just uses his real voice to tell them that someone is after them. He knows who he is dealing with here, Nacho, someone who had just told him that if he rats he dies. 

This next one is a reach, but I'll put it here anyways. When he talks Lalo into sending Kim, hoping that she goes to the cops which would result in Jimmy's death but would save Kim's life. Little did he know she would kill for him. The reason this is a reach is because it's to save the love of his life which plays a huge role in that.

The next one I'll put here is from breaking bad. When Walt asks Saul to call in a tip to save Hank's life. That's a risky, risky move even if he isn't naming Gus in his tip directly. Saul has no reason to do this other than to save Hank's life.

Now I know all of these are for tangible results (saving someone's life, making someone feel better, yada yada), but Jimmy regaining some self worth and respect from Kim is the result here. Jimmy has been repressing his guilt the whole show and decides to own up to everything so he can feel worthy of the name McGill again. Let's also not forget that he told Kim on their phone call to put her money where her mouth is so to speak, and she did, so he did the same. This factors into the decision a lot. All of that to say this, I believe the character we've been watching for 6 seasons is 100% capable of doing what he did in the finale, for the reasons I've stated. I understand if some disagree though.",More examples proving Jimmy's decision was in character (finale)

348,betterCallSaul,"Hey everyone,

As a die-hard fan of Better Call Saul, I wanted to take a moment to appreciate how the show has gone above and beyond its predecessor, Breaking Bad. While Breaking Bad was undoubtedly a masterpiece in its own right, I believe that Better Call Saul has truly transcended the original in terms of its storytelling, character development, and cinematography.

Firstly, the show's slow-burning plot has allowed for a more in-depth exploration of its characters. We see Jimmy McGill's transformation into Saul Goodman in a more gradual and nuanced way, which has allowed for a deeper understanding of his motivations and flaws. Additionally, characters like Kim, Mike, and Gus have been given more backstory and depth than we ever got to see in Breaking Bad.

Secondly, the show's cinematography is simply breathtaking. The use of color, lighting, and camera angles add a layer of meaning to every scene, making the show an artistic masterpiece as well as a compelling narrative.

Finally, the show's exploration of themes like morality, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power is truly thought-provoking. It's not just a crime drama, but a meditation on the human condition.

All in all, Better Call Saul has exceeded all expectations and become its own masterpiece. I would love to hear your thoughts on why the show is so great and what you're looking forward to in the upcoming season. Let's discuss!",The Genius of Better Call Saul: How the Show Transcends its Predecessor
349,betterCallSaul,"There is quite a bit going on with Jimmy's way of thinking in the finale. He had just nearly crossed the line of killing someone (Marion) but stopped himself, and in that moment I believe he truly realized how far he had fallen. The next moment that made him think about his next move was when he found out Kim confessed to the Howard scheme and was likely going to get sued. He had told her earlier on the phone call to put her money where her mouth is so to speak, and she did. He decided then to go against his plea deal and admit to everything that was haunting him in his repressed guilt. His actions as Saul, his role in what happened to Howard, and his role in Chuck's death (getting his insurance cancelled resulting in a wave of events that lead to what happened). He wanted to feel worthy of the McGill name again, so he did what he thought was the right thing. It's not about redemption in the eyes of the audience, it's about the character doing something for his own sense of self worth. Also, he wanted to show Kim that the man she once knew wasn't completely gone, he wanted to show her that deep down he is still Jimmy.",Jimmy's decision

417,betterCallSaul,"In a word, Yes! But it‚Äôs not for everyone. I think it‚Äôs one of the better dramas on TV currently, and maybe ever.

Its first three seasons, to me, feel a lot like a ‚Äúlawyer drama‚Äù with all the legal tension between main character Jimmy McGill and Howard Hamlin and Chuck and that was when I liked it best. 

I feel like these last couple seasons have ratcheted up the action a little bit more with the addition of Lalo Salamanca. He‚Äôs been a pretty solid villain so far and hasn‚Äôt detracted from the show.

If you liked Saul Goodman (Jimmy McGill) and Mike Ehrmantraut from Breaking Bad, you‚Äôre going to love Better Call Saul. You get to see a more vulnerable side to both of these characters and Bob Odenkirk (who plays Jimmy / Saul) puts on a masterclass performance showing you Jimmy‚Äôs moral descent. There‚Äôre also other returning characters from Breaking Bad such as Hector Salamanca, Tuco, Gus, Hank and Gomez return for an episode or two, and even Gale makes an appearance (poor guy).

If you like strong female characters, then you definitely get that with Kim Wexler and she‚Äôs been a very fresh addition to this show. Breaking Bad sometimes has a bad rep for not utilizing its female characters effectively, although I disagree, but Better Call Saul more than made up for it with Kim on this show.

It has some similarities to Breaking Bad, such as the atmosphere and cinematography as well as the returning characters of course. The difference between the two stories is that Saul is a man of earning money as a lawyer and Walter is a man of earning money by selling drugs. This is definitely a show that is worth watching and you will not be disappointed if you like Crime Drama, Legal Drama, or Black Comedy type shows.

For me, that is where Lalo storyline goes downhill and ends in a such an underwhelming way the next episode. (In my opinion, at least, most people seem to love that episode, lol)

If Jimmy and Kim had something to do with Lalo changing his plans, it would at least make some sense. If Lalo OR Howard spent some time at that house and the other one came in afterwards, again, it would make sense, at least mathematically. But 2 storylines colliding in almost zero probability, seems like a rushed way of getting rid of Howard (and the next episode Lalo), and focusing on Jimmy &amp; Kim storyline. 

I think this coincidence pretty much is similiar to Walter coming down to a bar after hiding in Alaska for almost a year, and seeing Elliott and Gretchen talking on TV about him at the exact same time. What are the chances?","One thing about ""Plan and Execution"" that bothers me so much"

516,betterCallSaul,"I've seen a few posts of late questioning whether we should feel pity for Chuck over his public humiliation at Jimmy's disciplinary hearing and I thought I'd add my stab. ***But with a twist***.

You can likely guess my thoughts on the first subject from the title, but I think the more interesting debate lies in whether we should view Jimmy's tactics in cutting Chuck down to size as something akin to framing a guilty man: Did Jimmy just use Chuck's mental illness to tear Chuck down on an essentially unrelated matter - their feud, the break-in, the confession? 

To answer this question, we first have establish what it is that Chuck did  wrong. Chuck is a fucking supervillain who masked his wrongdoing by cloaking it in a strict adherence to rules and ethics. He was the personification of the phrase ""immoral but not illegal"" and this is why I believe his downfall was a fitting form of accountability.

Yes, it may appear at first glance as if the shape of Chuck's public disgrace was unrelated to his dreadful behaviour. It's a seemingly random, gratuitous shaming that smacks of opportunism on Jimmy's part with the only connection being that Chuck's awful treatment of Jimmy forced the younger brother's hand. Chuck backed Jimmy in a corner and Jimmy used Chuck's mental illness to get out of it. But this is where the genius of this show's writing shines.

The nature of Chuck comeuppance is actually deeply connected to his misdeeds and, to see how, you just have to ask yourself one thing:

***Why did Jimmy provoking Chuck to lose his temper help win over members of the disciplinary board?***

In some ways, Jimmy's tactic make Chuck look more sympathetic. No one likes seeing an ill man bullying and picked on and humiliated by his own brother. But this worked for Jimmy precisely because it exposed the great fraud in how this man operates. It took Chuck McGill, a man who everyone outside his immediate inner circle sees as a paragon of rectitude, and exposed him as a conniving, resentful backstabber full of jealousy and hate. Instead of seeing Jimmy as a low class ne'er-do-well bad egg, terrorizing Chuck the classic honour student older sibling, the panel suddenly saw Jimmy as a beleaguer man, pushed past the breaking point of his saint-like patience by a vindictive, damaged big brother.

Jimmy knew what Chuck hated most about him - the clever tricks Jimmy pulled to get himself in and out of trouble - so Jimmy recognized that a slick bit of trickery would be just the right thing to set Chuck off and make him show his true colours. And that's all that happened. Jimmy played a trick on Chuck - one that got him sufficiently angry - and Chuck let loose with what he truly feels about Jimmy, laying bare his intent at entrapment. After all, do we think the panel would've side with Jimmy just because he exposed Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitive as being all in his head? No, it was the content of his backlash at Jimmy embarrassing at him that won Jimmy the day.

And we don't ask ourselves whether a child abuser deserves the embarrassment of being exposed a child abuser, do we?

The nature of Chuck debasement is no different. The only complication here is that we sympathize with Chuck due to his mental illness. But, even then, while Chuck clearly has deep issues that manifest themselves in a psychosomatic sickness, he's in control of his faculties when it comes to rational decisions. That's why, in the end, sympathetic as we may be, Chuck got a dose of accountability in its purest form: the truth of his actions being put on display to world.",Sympathy for the Devil: The Chuck McGill Story

523,betterCallSaul,"**Did Jimmy's statements about Hamlin do anything to help Kim's pending legal problems in the finale? **

Just finished the show, and my initial impression was that Jimmy's main motivator was to help Kim with her legal situation by publicly taking accountability for Hamlin's death. Was reading through some past threads, and the general consensus seems to be that he just did it to gain her respect, and now I'm not so sure. It's obvious he wanted to gain her respect, but I still think he was trying to help her legally. Here's my initial reasoning based on the sequence of events:

He doesn't switch up his statement about Kim and Hamlin until after he finds out Hamlin's wife wants to sue Kim. If all he cared about was getting Kim's approval and the whole negotiation was just a ""catch and release"" as some people seem to think,  **why would finding out Kim might get sued be the catalyst for his actions? **

In the courthouse, he waits until he has been sworn in to bring up Kim and Hamlin. Stating that Kim had nothing to do with Hamlin's death is **literally the first thing he does** after taking the oath, and the whole time he's pointing at Kim and looking directly at the federal prosecutor he's been wheeling and dealing with. I interpreted this as Jimmy subtly letting the prosecutor know why he was confessing.

He then proceeds to face the judge and make a concise confession,  owning up to everything the prosecution wanted from him. After that, Jimmy once again faces the prosecutor and asks ""you got that?"" and he responds with a slight nod. 

I took this short exchange between the two of them as Jimmy subtly making one last (unofficial and off the books) deal with the prosecutor: protect Kim and  I'll publicly take the fall for all the terrible things that have happened. 

It's only after this exchange that Jimmy looks to Kim for approval, and starts talking about all the other irrelevant stuff to try and get it. 

So what do u think? Any merit to this hypothesis? **I know a federal prosecutor wouldn't have any official involvement in a civil suit** but is it possible (within the breaking bad universe, not real life) that this could help Kim if she decided that she wanted to fight the civil suit? Maybe the prosecutor could talk to Hamlin's widow? Maybe she would decide since the ""real villain"" was behind bars and told the truth about Chuck and Hamlin in a very public, high profile case, going after Kim just wouldn't be worth it? Maybe having the government accept Jimmy's sworn statement as fact would help if it ever came to trial? At the very least, it should definitely close the door on the unlikely possibility that Kim would ever be prosecuted. 

Idk, it just seemed apparent to me that Jimmy believed he was helping Kim in some way by doing what he did, and I was curious what everybody's thoughts were.",Question about the finale

525,betterCallSaul,,"Unironically there‚Äôs so much sexual tension in this scene. Could Howard have secretly had a thing for Jimmy this entire time?

I only watched the final season once so I don‚Äôt recall if this was ever made clear, but him not consuming caffeine on a regular basis would certainly be in line with his calm, cool and collected character.

We don't see how he got taken from the nursing home in Better call Saul to the country where we first see him in Breaking bad.

532,betterCallSaul,"I know Cheryl was added to give us more sympathy and heartache over what happens to Howard. The issue is Cheryl from what we see seems bitter and cold and obviously no one has sung her praises as a character. She feels like a female character the BCS writers drove clear of in light of the awful reactions to Skyler in Breaking Bad. Based on viewers sexist perceptions of female characters (women in general) and Cheryl only plays into the mean/helpless housewife clich√© with far less dimension/background/resonance than Marie and Skyler. 

What's so odd is while trying to make us feel bad for Howard we in turn naturally are made to dislike Cheryl. Of course we don't see her side of the marriage but since we don't why should we care about her? Howard is trying to build his business back up after Chuck died and being pranked by Jimmy while offering Jimmy a job and Cheryl looks like the, ''bitch mom who wouldn't cut him any slack'' (words from Skyler). Howard had suffered enough to gain our sympathy after being yelled/mistreated by Kim and Jimmy and losing Chuck. Unintentionally the writers gave us another character to be against for weak reasons.

Cliff should have been the sole collateral of the pranks pulled on Howard since we've known him for years on the show/and has his views skewed on his friend before/after his death. Obviously one of the biggest gut punches is HHM crumbles so that's another layer to Howard's downfall. 

Now I personally don't hate Cheryl but I kept questioning what she added no pre-existing characters could have added. We weren't given indication she existed until season 6 and not given much background on her besides being Howard's distant wife. Having a difficult marriage feels trivial in the face of the adversity faced by Howard that the only mention we needed was when Howard brought it up before his demise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please note this is an issue with her writing and not the actress herself who performed the role great all things considered. I just can't argue in favor of Cheryl as a character especially this far in the show and being a lacking addition to such a well written cast.",Nothing but respect for the actress but Cheryl feels like an unnecessary addition to season 6.

Clearly, he was way overqualified and would have made a great detective‚Ä¶in fact, the wide range of skills and knowledge he displays in the present day would probably make more sense to his character if he had dealt with higher-level organized criminal activity from the other side of the law. Additionally, he seems to have a very close rapport and short-hand with the older Philly detective who comes to Albuquerque in season 1 of BCS, indicating a lot of familiarity there.

546,betterCallSaul,,A question on my little brothers history quiz.
547,betterCallSaul,"Much like the Fast and the Furious franchise, the theme of family dominates the BB/BCS Universe‚Ä¶ well, maybe moreso with BB. 

Walt (allegedly) did it all for his family. Then there‚Äôs Jesse; a man rejected by his own family (for justifiable reasons) who latched onto Walt as a father figure. Mike, similar to Walt, wanted to protect and provide for his granddaughter. Gus even pretended to have a wife and kids to manipulate Walt. La familia es todo, according to Hector.

Yes, the theme exists in BCS, but to a lesser degree. At least, not really between parents and their kids. We get closest to that dynamic with Nacho and his dad, but those scenes are less frequent. There‚Äôs also a few flashbacks to Jimmy and Kim‚Äôs respective childhoods, but that‚Äôs about it. To me, the stakes felt higher in BB when Walt faced death because his kids were in danger too, as Gus made known to him in Crawl Space.

The BB children are the only truly innocent characters who are still alive. Walt Jr. Holly. Kaylee. Brock. Not Jake though, I hate that kid. So how would Peter and Vince raise the stakes in a sequel? The easy solution would be to introduce Jimmy‚Äôs long lost child.

Of course, the reboot would revolve around the children grown up, but those are a bit more predictable. Jimmy‚Äôs kid can be a completely original character like Chuck and Nacho.

It‚Äôs clich√© to introduce a long lost kid, so let‚Äôs make it funny. The mother would be the woman Jimmy met during his Cicero trip when, for one night, he was Kevin Costner. Holly would have just finished celebrating her high school graduation when she‚Äôd be cleaning up and discover the tape of Walt talking to her as his then-unborn child. Skylar would come in, turn it off, and it would be a whole thing. Kaylee would be a cop who tries not to succumb to corruption and crime like her dad and Pop Pop did, throw in a line for the fans though like ‚Äúyeah, everyone says I look young for my age‚Äù. Brock would unfortunately fall in with a new gang/cartel, maybe Kaylee/Brock interactions could be interesting like Hank/Jesse interactions. Walt Jr., definitely now Flynn, would be an IHOP franchise manager, because breakfast. Anyway, back to Jimmy‚Äôs son.

True to today‚Äôs fashion trends, his attire would be relatively sleek but lifeless (black, white and grey clothes, definitely no colorful ties). He‚Äôs nothing like Jimmy: not particularly mischievous, doesn‚Äôt get old movie references, respects authority, but then we get a scene of him listening to Smoke on the Water to show maybe there‚Äôs something inside, waiting to be unleashed. He‚Äôs always wondered about a world beyond Cicero, but not enough to seek it out. His mom saw Jimmy on TV due to all the press coverage over the Goodman Debacle. Seeing him would cause her mood to change, to the point where he‚Äôd press her on it and find out that‚Äôs his dad. He would then seek him out in prison and yada yada yada.

This allows Jimmy to explore a relationship with someone besides Kim, perhaps helping him grow more and serving as a reminder that, despite the prisoner‚Äôs chants, he‚Äôs more than Saul Goodman. Now, he‚Äôs a father too. This can also give the BB/BCS Extended Universe a chance to catch up to the present day rather than stay set in the mid-to-late-2000s. I think there‚Äôs more to explore with this concept than Young Gus, but I‚Äôd watch both!

We get a couple of lines that mention Mike‚Äôs time with the military. It‚Äôs easy to accept that Mike was familiar with the weapon with just the few lines we got.

603,betterCallSaul,"In my opinion, unlike Walter, who in some way, can be said that always would become a manic, hungry with power, Jimmy could had a good life, even after his brother.

Walter, in his head, had a mediocre life, and the only chance he had do be something more was becoming a drug lord.

Jimmy was a con man, shure, but you see that he tries to play by the rules, and become a honest lawyer (in the maximum way he can) for a while.

Shure he would do something fancy once in a while, but you could see, despite walter that was in the way to hell for a while, Jimmy, like his brother said, could restart over and actually be free of all of it, at least until the day Lalo came into their room with howard.

It just sadder me, that despite walter, mike, gus, and jessy, that for me they had a destructive personality, Jimmy, even being a con man, could have managed that, i mean, you can still be a con man and play the legal game, there are a lot of these moments in the series, and jimmy could have been happy doing this, jimmy actually could have been succeed.

The special love I had for you...
My Baby Blue"" 
  Jimmy still loved Kim, despite the casual way he says goodbye to her after signing the divorce papers in ""Waterworks"": "" Have a nice life, Kim.""

"" All the days became so long"" 
 Jimmy used the mask of Saul Goodman to cope with all the mental baggage and trauma that being partially responsible for Chuck's death, being responsible along with Kim for the utter destruction of Howard's reputation even after his death, and Kim leaving him. When he couldn't be Saul anymore after Walter was revealed to be Heisenberg, his months living as Gebe Takavic were soul-crushingly dreary and also filled with paranoia, constantly living with the fear of being caught. Hence, "" All the days became so long""

"" Did you really think I'd do you wrong?"" 
 Kim was probably expecting Jimmy to throw her under the bus for all the crimes he committed as Saul, but then he revealed that it was in fact just a ruse to get her to come to his court hearing so that she could see him confess to all of his crimes, and prove to her and to himself that he was indeed capable of doing the right thing. 
 
All this is just to say that the lyrics are fitting, not necessarily that it should have been used instead of "" Shared Smoke"", the music that plays during Jimmy and Kim's very first scene in BCS Season 1, in which they each share and smoke a cigarette in the underground parking garage of HHM. ""Saul Gone"" was a bittersweet finale, unlike ""Felina"", which was actually more triumphant in nature, because Walt tied up all loose ends, made sure his family had to enough money to survive on, killed all his enemies, set Jesse free, and died on his own terms without the police catching him. So it's really  a happy ending, and Baby Blue was perfect for that. I just thought it was crazy that the lyrics lined up well for Saul Gone as well as Felina.
  ""Shared Smoke"" was the perfect song to end the show with, since Better Call Saul is also a really great love story aside from being a gripping drama.","I just realised that ""Baby Blue"" would be a great ending song for ""Saul Gone"" as well."

637,betterCallSaul,"I have reason to believe that Charles ""Chuck"" Lindbergh McGill Jr is not dead, despite what S3 E10 of Better Call Saul, ""Lantern"", would like you to believe. This is because:

1) We never see a body in any of the succeeding episodes. How could they have proven a death without a body, hmm?

2) If you visit the address in real life, his house is still there as it was presented in the show. This means it could not have possibly burned down, and Chuck may have invented some sort of hologram or cloaking device to fool everyone, which would not be out of the ordinary for the Breaking Bad universe as it has been established that Lalo can fly, which is of course not possible in our world. It would also be possible as Chuck has been shown to be one of the academically smartest characters on the show, rivalling Walter and Finger.

3) Micheal McKean, the actor who plays Chuck, is also still alive. How could this possibly be, unless of course... 
He. Isn't. Dead.

4) This is my final, and most damning piece, of evidence. In the finale of the entire show, ""Saul Gone"", there is a scene which clearly shows Chuck still alive and well, having a conversation with Jimmy. You may try and say ""But Jimmy was just reminiscing!"" Wrong! If you had paid attention to the episode, you would notice that Jimmy has ""flashbacks"" with two other ""dead"" characters, Walter Hartwell White and Micheal Erhmantraut, and talks about the concept of time machines with them. Yep, it's all coming together. Chuck, Walter and Mike never died. Walter tells Jesse that Mike is living in Belize, Chuck is seen in the finale and Walter is still alive as definitely proven by the video which Film Theory uploaded a while ago.

674,betterCallSaul,"Was thinking about Lalo plan in season 6, after the ambush when he wanted revenge. 

Lalo fast evolving plans 

\- He used the last member of the commando to make himself dead in the eyes of Gus

Once ""dead"" he returned to ABQ and observed Lavanderia Brillante. He knew Gus superlab was there. 

Lalo initial plan was not to kill Gus: Eladio would do it but he needed proof of course. So Lalo wanted to sneak into LB, get the proof, and run away to Eladio. Surprise was key to that plan, and since Lalo was supposed to be dead... 

Alas,  **Hector was Lalo main weakness**. 

\- Lalo should never have phoned him and told him he was alive.

 Hector ruined Lalo plans twice.

First, when he taunted Gus with a happy stare - and Gus deduced Lalo wasn't dead. 

So Gus put Casa Tranquila under watch and listening devices, and it worked: second time Lalo phoned Hector, he betrayed he was alive. 

After ruining the chair in anger, Lalo changed his plan. 

Ok, so Gus and Mike waits for my return in ABQ, but where and when ? they have no clue. So, in order to assault LB,  Lalo replaced surprise with a faint / decoy move. 

A faint / decoy ? and there came the cucaracha in the sewer. ""*Your husband, is like... la cucaracha. Born survivor !*"" 

So Lalo new plan: takes Jimmy / Kim hostages and use them as decoy to lure Mike's men away from LB. 

Some important points there: 

\- Lalo doesn't know Mike knows Jimmy since the sticker days, and Kim from more recently 

\- **it doesn't matter**, because the real deal is for the decoy to run at Gus house and say to Mike ""Lalo is alive, Lalo has returned to ABQ !"" Mike and his men of course will put Gus in the bunker and run to intercept Lalo. 

\- Lalo initial plan is **not** to kill Gus. It is to run to the Lavanderia after the decoy lured Mike teams away, get the proof, and escape to Eladio's. 

\- Lalo **doesn't think Gus is crazy enough to face him alone**, at Lavanderia or elsewhere. Even if Gus doesn't fear him, Gus is no match to Lalo in hand combat or fire fight (cough, cough). Gus of course think otherwise, and that's why he hid that gun in the caterpillar, plus he will put the place in the dark. 

Gus plan to survive an encounter with Lalo is just insanely crazy and risky  (just watch Mike reaction to it afterwards !) but, hey, its Gus Fring: the man who, in BB, walked against Gaff the sniper with his arms raised as a challenge ""Sure, go kill me and tell your boss Eladio or Bolsa"". 

Gus plan to survive Lalo was based on three elements 

\- he knew the place, the terrain: his superlab hole in the ground 

\- he prepared a surprise: the gun in the caterpillar tracks 

\- another surprise: the lights out. 

The plan worked, but it was a close call ! 

**Back to Lalo decoy plan.** He wents to their house blissfully unaware poor Howard Hamlin was there. Then he used Howard to make his point and submit Kim and Jimmy into terror and submission -it certainly worked. 

Except it was Kim, no Jimmy, that went to Gus as decoy. 

Lalo original plan without Howard **still need some kind of terror to make the point** against ""those two and their mouths, *Dios mios*"". 

My bet is: since he planned to send Jimmy, he **needs to do something... brutal to Kim** to beat Jimmy into terror and submission. 

Then, think of **Casper in ""Axe and grind"".** My bet is **Lalo would put a bullet into Kim feet**. You can guess Jimmy would obey him afterwards and play the decoy role to perfection. Whatever he said to send Kim in his place. 

Your thoughts ? I like to speculate and analyse BCS.",Lalo plan: how it evolved (SPOILERS !)

Should I stop immediately and watch all of BB? Or can I continue BCS to a point in s6 before going into BB and then back to the end of BCS?,Question about how screwed am I
676,betterCallSaul,"Everything else I can understand (hate, resentment, sabotage, etc.) but, for all of how high and mighty Chuck sees himself, why purposefully deceive Jimmy and use him for support? Was he really fine with the idea that his seemingly inferior conman brother Slippin' Jimmy is supporting him?",Why did Chuck lie to Jimmy?
677,betterCallSaul,,I call it the addict version
678,betterCallSaul,"Of course most people on this sub feel or hold awareness of what most of us can agree is the basic idea-- he wanted Chuck's love and respect, he didn't get it, then he wanted it from Kim, he didn't get it, so he becomes Saul to cope.

My question is, since the show is so open to interpretation, what makes Saul Goodman his coping mechanism rather than any alternative? How specifically does Saul serve as a way to cope with his issues?

My current theory is that as Jimmy McGill, he tried to be who he felt would garner respect from Chuck and/or the society around him-- someone with a law-abiding, well-paying job who didn't commit scams that hurt people. But because he kept failing to meet those ideals-- either because the quicker rewards of the con were too hard to resist given the taxation of his day-to-day problems (S1) or because conning made him feel less lonely because it reminded him of when the only people who he was confident loved him, his parents and Marco, were still around (S2-3)-- and because his failure to meet those ideals consequently gave Chuck and other people (e.g.: Cliff, Air Force guy) a reason to voice their lack of respect for him, he felt that he would never be able to become someone worthy of love and respect. 

And because this feeling was too painful for him to deal with, he became Saul, because being Saul allows him to create a fantasy in which he fails to become someone respectable not because (as he feels deep down) he's unable to, but because he doesn't want to, because he enjoys being a slimy effing douchebag who hurts other people. By telling himself this lie, he can lie to himself that he is still capable of becoming a respectable person, and has only not become one because he doesn't want to become one, thus allowing him to avoid the pain of feeling like he is unable to become one.

Easy and simple. And giving some pressure after failing to persuade Irene. (I doubt Irene will say no since everyone trusts Jimmy ).  This plot is more like forcing Jimmy to leave the elder law in an unnatural way.
2. Papa Varga didn't get the ID and left. The cartel knew that Nacho is the rat and there is no chance for Papa Varga. Mike promised that he will protect the dad but I assume that means Gus will not kill him. Can you protect him 24/7? Papa Varga should finally understand his child and leave the town.

729,betterCallSaul,"To sum it up, Mike (and Gus) were furious that Werner was haphazardly chatting about constructing the secret underground lab with random people at the bar. Initially, Werner tried to downplay the whole thing, but after pressure from Mike, Werner admitted he screwed up and he was very sorry. 

Mike told Gus that he had a ""come to Jesus"" talk with Werner, and Werner should be trustworthy from now on.

But, why wasn't there a ""one strike and you're out"" full measure approach here? Yes, I can understand that they've already invested time and money into the project, but I could imagine that another contractor could pick things up from there. 

Maybe if they would've let Werner go right there, when he showed he couldn't be fully trusted, he wouldn't have snuck out and been untrustworthy again.

\-put himself in debt so crippling that if it was put on the law firm they'd go belly up and the entire firm would lose their jobs, all so he could get Chuck the hell out after he clearly lost his mind (and I'm not talking about the electricity thing).

756,betterCallSaul,"OK I've just finished rewatching this episode for the first time and it hits differently when you've rewatched the series in order. Stopped BCS after Kim left Jimmy, watch all of Breaking Bad and El Camino before returning to the last 4 episodes of BCS. The entire story folding out, the characters that came and went in both series and the movie, the drama, the conflicts. Everything. This episode is good as it is on its own but doing a complete watch through? Even better

Did Jimmy ever truly change in the end? Yes and no. Yes he did in the sense he owned up  to his crimes and took his punishment like a man. Finally allowing himself to feel his morn as well as feel guilt over Chuck and Howard. No because Chuck did prove himself right Jimmy would never change his ways of being a con man. Jimmy's life as Gene proved it while in hiding. Chances are if Jimmy followed through with his 7 year deal. He'd be right back to scamming. The fact he purged himself in court shows he was very self aware as a person 

But by purging himself and remaining behind bars, Jimmy can atone for his sins with no temptation of conning anyone ever again

A true definitive end to the greatest cinematic and well connected universe in all forms of TV shoes and movies. It's superior to the MCU given its acting, depth, well rounded and memorable characters, the themes and conflicts. Bravo Vince. Bravo to the writers. Bravo to the cast. Bravo everyone involved. It was one hell of a ride seeing this overarching story play out in order",Revisiting Saul Gone
757,betterCallSaul,"Idk if anyone has raised it yet but I'm rewatching Nippy and I keep getting reminded of Red Dead Redemption 2.

The final turn of the story has been told; Kim leaving and Howard dying are what officially drives Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman. The bell has been rung.

He was always a little shady and a con man at heart, he dealt with and encouraged dodgy clients, but at his core he had some semblance of good and morality. Kim leaving him is what finally drove him into becoming the mess of a person we see in Breaking Bad. If Kim and Jimmy stayed together post 2008 I very much doubt he'd have helped Walter and Jesse after Badger, let alone seeking Walt out in his school and encouraging him to become a kingpin and finding him connections. Jimmy even laid it out in court; Walter White wouldn't have made it without me. With Kim being his anchor point for goodness, he absolutely wouldn't have gone that deep.

The conceit of the show is let's take the wacky lawyer comic relief and see his origin for a laugh. After Fun and Games it's mission accomplished- now we know.

Then as an aside we wrap up other characters origins as a courtesy, right down to the cartel. We find out a hint of who Gustavo Fring is on the personal side. Mike has a small quandary about his work vs his personal objections of the job and finally Nacho's story gets a wrap up with his dad getting some closure and a little fuck you to Mike on all the dressage of crime.

A show like Oz would have that as a finale, with all the loose ends being tied up.

Obviously the Gene storyline is still going, but in my opinion, even in 2015, it was complementary fan service that didn't add much to the main story (not meaning to bash it. it's great). Whatever Saul got up to post Breaking Bad is interesting yeah, but it doesn't relate to the main story- Sandpiper, Mesa Verde, Howard, Chuck, Gus v Nacho, etc- it's supplementary. That's from a stuffy network exec or traditional show runners perspective.

So from Nippy onward, does anybody else feel like it's more of a coda or an epilogue? An encore for more just to say goodbye and give you more if you want it?

If anyones played Red Dead 2 you'll know what I mean ( I don't want to spoil it for anybody that hasn't played it)","Does anybody else consider Fun and Games to be the true finale, and the Gene episodes more of an epilogue?"

I mean, what can I even say about this show? I don't even know what it's about. With Walter, it's simple. He wants to provide for his family, so he does. And he loves his family so much that he can't stop providing for them even after making millions of dollars. With Jimmy...he tells Chuck he's not Slippin' Jimmy anymore, then he tries to strangle an old lady and tells Kim to have a nice life. Like it doesn't even make sense? And Lalo tells Howard ""Me? I'm Nobody,"" which shows how carelessly this show has been written because even I know that his name is Lalo Salamanca.

Not to mention that this show is so slooooooooooooooow. I'm not against slow films, I've watched Cars 2. And I'm not against ""character development"" either, because I've watched Breaking Bad and seen first hand how Walt's family developed from respecting him to being ungrateful.

777,betterCallSaul,"Hi! I loved Breaking Bad (watched it for the first time when Covid and loved it), and I saw a lot of people saying Better Call Saul is as good if not better than BB.

Thing is... I started the show last year, and dropped it after 3 episodes, I just found it boring and nothing exciting... Last week I decided to give it a second chance with an open mind... I am 2 episodes from finishing season 2 but... it's still not exciting... I don't know what to say, BB kept me on my toes, (Walter and Jesse were great characters), it was exciting, I just wanted to watch another episode when I finished one, but I'm not feeling this with BCS... I get the thing about introducing characters etc... but do it like other shows, in 2-3 episodes, not 2 seasons.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just different but coming from BB, I was expecting a show as good as BB in terms of excitement, dangerous situations, a show to make me feel anxious about the characters and how thing will develop. Maybe this show is more like Suits, all law stuff with some Cartel/Drug Dealing sprinkles here and there, but I was expecting something different to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, it has nice moments that reminded me of BB, like when Jimmy (when is he going to go for Saul already???) was almost killed in the desert with those 2 ginger twins and Tuco, or when Mike got his face wrecked to get Tuco arrested etc... That was BB at its finest and I really enjoyed that, I honestly couldn't care less about Jimmy working for this firm, or Kim working for that firm etc... it makes the show boring IMO (when it's aaaalways the same, and it's been for 2 seasons almost, with a few enjoying moments).

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, when does it get better? Is it gonna be like this the whole 6 seasons? If so then I don't know how people say it's better than BB when they are pretty much completely different tv shows and wouldn't make sense to compare them, unless...

I agree that it was predictable, even though that fact doesn't bother me, I can see why it's a problem for others. But one criticism that I think is misplaced is about Lalo's decision to allow Gus to go on talking for so long. This actually isn't a forced contrivance, Lalo had faked his own death without telling anyone except Hector and was plotting to kill Gus, likely the cartel's biggest earner. Don Eladio might not be so pleased about Lalo doing all this just to prove Gus had a hole in the ground. He was hiding it, yes, but that might not warrant taking him out. So Lalo let's Gus rant for a bit, get him on video saying how much he hates them Salamancas and is planning on getting revenge on the entire cartel. That video would have saved Lalo from any scrutiny from the cartel.","Something some people miss about 608 ""Point and Shoot."""

894,betterCallSaul,"First and foremost, it can't be stated enough: Thank the Lord that Bob Odenkirk made a full recovery from his heart attack during the final season production. It's unfortunately way too common to have severe disabilities after having a heart attack....or worse, death.

So it's truly a miracle and we can be so thankful that Bob managed to recover and is alive and happy, and that he got to finish the episodes for the final season.

But....what if things were a little less ""chance"" and the fast medical response time was secretly organized by Vince Gilligan? What if Vince foresaw this terrible, terrible event and put in measures to ensure that Bob was going to have immediate care?

Let me explain.

Firstly, I'm NOT discrediting that Bob Odenkirk had a heart attack--he really did! According to an NPR report, his heart STOPPED for 18 minutes!! Thankfully, someone on set knew how to perform CPR and there was a defibrillator to use. 

Again....how was there such a rapid response time though? Heart attacks are not uncommon...according to the CDC, there's a heart attack every FORTY SECONDS in the USA. While the general population has a heightened awareness to this possibly occurring, it's eerie that Bob was able to have SUCH a fantastic recovery.

Well let me direct your attention to Better Call Saul, Season 4 Episode 6:  Pi√±ata, approximately 22 minutes into the episode/25:30 minutes left of the episode. To sum it up, Jimmy is having an upsetting conversation with Kim....she told him she'll be going with Schweikart &amp; Cokely, effectively crushing Jimmy's aspirations for them to be partners. 

Now, at that time stamp, it was likely Jimmy was suffering from what John Hopkin's calls ""Broken Heart Syndrome"" (stress cardiomyopathy). But what are the symptoms associated with that? **Chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, feeling of impending doom**....Well, what are some heart attack symptoms? **Chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, feelings of impending doom**...

We know that Vince Gilligan is a MASTER of putting in subtle symbolism, motifs, hidden meanings, ""Easter Eggs"", etc. in his shows (BB/BCS), and I think this was one of them. 

Vince, somehow, knew that Bob Odenkirk was indeed going to suffer a heart attack in the future. So, as some SUPER foreshadowing, Vince put in a quick scene in season 4 to depict just that. Vince is really flexing with his symbolism and deeper meanings to his episodes. 

I thought Vince was a phenomenal writer, producer, and director before, but THIS is just beyond comprehension. I wonder if Vince later told Bob about all of this?",Bob Odenkirk's heart attack was FORESHADOWED in an earlier BSC episode (S4:E6)

904,betterCallSaul,"Todd‚Äôs personality is one of the most intriguing for me from breaking bad and el camino. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me that didn‚Äôt had a click and fully understood him and everyone already gets its but here goes nothing. 
at the same time he shots a kid, he waves before with a smile like ‚Äúoh hey a kid‚Äù, when he asks jesse for help with the lady he killed he says how she is honest and a good worker, like how he feels bad about doing it. 
at the same time he killed all those people and he literally keeps a pet tarantula from the day he shot a kid in his room with his little decorated aquarium. I get the part that his an asshole, an sociopath, a monster. 
I don‚Äôt get the part that he has those thoughts like what he is doing is really not that much, like he was doing what had to be done all the time. he thoughts jesse is his friend trough the ENTIRE show, including why he was killed by jesse itself. how does it not occur to him that jesse is his prisioner and not his friend?

I guess my main question is: why is he so chill? 

he is not chill in the way Lalo Salamanca (who knows he‚Äôs a piece of shit and loves it) is or mean like Hector for example. he‚Äôs chill as a nice person would be (excluding all the deaths etc.). he really thinks he can be friends with jesse, he likes lydia, he tries to make small talk with jesse trough el camino. 

I genuinely think he believes he is a flawed good person lol. 

like try imagining hector, walter, lalo even killing that child. no one would do it on a such strange way like him. he is so oblivious of himself, I really dont get him at all.

Not only does it have my favorite episodes (Switch, Klick), but I think the entire arc is the greatest that TV has ever had to offer. Jimmy Vs. Chuck is at its peak here. Even though season 3 shows the battle in it's most extreme, those scenes are really just aftermath for what happened in season 2. I love the back and forth between the 2 brothers, and to me, this is the epitome of what Better Call Saul is all about. The switching of the numbers, the sneaking of the tape recorder. I just loved it.

The Davis &amp; Main stuff has its own special charm. I need not say more.

I believe (and this is just my own theory) that season 2 has most little to do with breaking bad. There is no cartel, meth lab, etc. And it's maybe for this reason that Breaking Bad fans overlook it. I can't prove this. It's just a hunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Hector can get hot tempered.  Or jealous.",Did they have to do what they did to Ximinez?
970,betterCallSaul,"During the initial broadcast airing, I had the hardest time remembering and recognizing Arturo's involvement from seasons 2 - 4.  Every time I saw him, I had to ask myself ""what else did this guy do before?""

&amp;#x200B;

Now during a rewatch (I'm almost done with season 3), I can see how he's always in meetings, or doing other jobs, starting with 2x06.  

&amp;#x200B;

But then other times, he's doing things like digging the grave for Ximinez, the truck driver.

&amp;#x200B;

But I still can't recall a scene where his name is mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this show doesn't always say things directly.  For example, Kim's name was not mentioned until 1x03, when she called Jimmy to ask him what he meant the other night when he said someone might come after the Kettlemans.  In 1x01, Chuck referred to her as ""your friend the promising lawyer at HHM"".  That was the closest they got to saying her name, or who she was, in 1x01.

&amp;#x200B;

And Vince Gilligan has said repeatedly on the podcast, that he does not like writing such as ""how many years have we been brothers"", to point out that the relationship between two people is brothers.  He considers it bad writing.

&amp;#x200B;

That was still easier to figure out though, in 1x01, because Chuck and Jimmy both had the last name McGill.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Victor and Tyrus, on Breaking Bad, all got their names mentioned at some point.  I don't think it has happened yet during my Better Call Saul rewatch.  So someone who had never seen Breaking Bad, might not know their names.  I believe at least one of them will get their names mentioned once, possibly during 4x02.  Maybe I would have had the same problem with Victor and Tyrus on Better Call Saul, if I had never seen Breaking Bad, as I had with Arturo.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think by the time they appear in their 3rd or 4th episode, it would be nice if their names are mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's wiki and IMDB where I could look that up, but it helps if it's explained within the show itself.  Just makes it easier to remember, since the visual and dialogue are then associated with the name.",Is Arturo's name ever explicitly mentioned on the show?

973,betterCallSaul,"Hector goes into Los Pollos Hermanos and forces a meeting with Gus.  He tells him ""you are my drug mule"", and Hector WILL use Gus' trucks.

Gus said he didn't want to do it.

But Hector's disrupting his Los Pollos Hermanos business, and forcing bad exposure, made Gus appease Hector so Hector wouldn't threaten more bad exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

Hector then even pushes things, by taking 6 stacks of money, instead of 5.  He tells Nacho to do that when he and Arturo meet with Tyrus and Victor.

&amp;#x200B;

Hector does seem upset that Tyrus pulled a gun on Nacho, when Nacho attempted to take the 6th stack of money.

&amp;#x200B;

He then wants to find a new way to transport his business, using the A1 Upholstery shop that Manuel Varga owns.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, during a phone meeting with Don Eladio from across the border, Hector is mad that Juan Bolsa and Don Eladio like using Gus' trucks, and are praising Gus for doing so.  Gus repeats to Hector again, that while he's doing it, he doesn't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Was it that praise that sent Hector over the edge, to resenting it?  Also taking into account that Gus had upstaged Hector before, in 1999, when he brought possibly 3x the money Hector did to Don Eladio, AND it was neatly wrapped.  No stacks of money in rubber bands inside a duffel bag.

1000,betterCallSaul,"(Will add a disclaimer that this is not intended as a critique of either show, I think both Walter and Saul are excellent characters for what the writers are attempting. Also, obligatory spoiler warning for BCS and BB)

I feel like it‚Äôs extremely common to see people categorize Walter as a tragic villain - basically, a fundamentally good person drawn to horrible actions as a result of less than ideal circumstances. But I think this is a fundamental misreading of Walter as a character: the first season of the show literally has him rejecting an offer to pay for his cancer treatments because of his ego, so he instead continued being a fucking meth dealer. He even admits at the end of the show that he did it for him - that the excitement and power he had as a meth dealer was his primary motivation, not getting money for cancer or even leaving money for his children. 

None of this is to say that Walter is a poorly written character - far from it. I just think he‚Äôs an excellently written example of a fundamentally bad person whose badness never really has an opportunity to shine through until his 50s. A person who holds a lifelong grudge against his ex-girlfriend and former business partner for no justifiable reason, who watches a woman choke to death and lets it happen, who then uses that incident to taunt his former business partner after he just gave him to a neo-nazi gang, who poisons a child and attempts to sexually assault his wife.

In my view, Saul works infinitely better as a character whose arc is that of moral decency to genuine depravity. Saul‚Äôs primary motivation, after clawing at the approval of Chuck, really is to provide an adequate defense for those without it. Saul really does care about other people, and is even willing to burn his reputation just so an old lady can still liked by her friends.

This isn‚Äôt to say Saul is perfect in BCS - again, far from it. He too often lets his ego and vindictiveness get the better of him. His 1216 ploy against Chuck was indefensible and his pranks against Howard make the phrase ‚Äúwildly disproportionate‚Äù lose its meaning.

Still, though, these actions are in line with a person who has a fundamentally adequate moral code tempted and eventually consumed by darkness, instead of Walter, who I think of as mostly bad from the gate.",I think Saul works much better as a sympathetic protagonist than Walter

Learnt a few variations of that particular exercise over the years, usually naming (not aloud) things you can see, hear or feel.

One might think that this concludes Saul Goodman's story; however, as Vince Gilligan described, Saul Goodman is a ""cockroach""; Saul Goodman will DEFINITELY try escaping prison. He has the contacts, from an unnamed Belarusian hacker to fake Heisenberg (James Kilkelly aka Jimmy In-N'-Out) to the Disappearer (Ed Galbraith); that book of contacts seen in ""Axe and Grind"" likely contains many more to orchestrate the escape.

The DEA would not have seized the drug money because it came from Gretchen and Elliot. However, the DEA will start being suspicious once the White family starts SPENDING that $9M of drug money. Skyler White will likely not report this money because she wants he kids to have a bright future; however, the DEA will question Skyler White about this money, and charges might be levied against Skyler White because of this.",Saul Goodman's and Skyler White's stories are NOT over.

&amp;#x200B;

Saul Goodman, the savvy criminal defense lawyer, stood in front of the judge, confidently facing the court. He was there to represent the most notorious drug kingpin in history, Pablo Escobar, and to make a deal with the government that would save both Escobar's business and his own skin.

The judge looked down at Saul skeptically, but the lawyer was undeterred. He had made a career out of getting his clients out of sticky situations, and he was determined to do the same for Escobar.

""Your Honor,"" Saul began, ""I understand that my client's actions have been, shall we say, less than desirable. But I assure you that he is willing to negotiate a peace with the government that will benefit all parties involved.""

The judge raised an eyebrow. ""Really? And what exactly is Mr. Escobar offering in return for this peace?""

Saul leaned forward, his eyes shining with a cunning glint. ""Mr. Escobar is offering to work with the government to control the drug trade in a way that will minimize its impact on society. In return, he asks for a chance to continue to run his business and to be allowed to live freely.""

The judge leaned back in his chair, considering Saul's proposal. ""And what makes you think the government will agree to such a deal?""

Saul spread his arms wide. ""Your Honor, my client has built an empire. He has resources and connections that the government would be foolish to ignore. And, as we all know, the drug trade is not going away anytime soon. It's in everyone's best interest to find a way to manage it, rather than letting it spiral out of control.""

The judge nodded, but still looked skeptical. ""And what about Mr. Escobar's past crimes? How do you propose to address those?""

Saul smiled, knowing that he had the answer. ""Your Honor, Mr. Escobar is willing to turn over all of his assets and to cooperate with the government in any investigations. In exchange, he asks for a reduced sentence and immunity from future prosecution.""

The judge leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. After a moment, he nodded. ""Very well, Mr. Goodman. I will take your proposal into consideration. But I have to warn you, the government is not going to be eager to make a deal with a known criminal like Mr. Escobar. You have your work cut out for you.""

Saul nodded, undaunted. He was a master negotiator, and he was confident that he could make this deal happen. And, if all went well, he would come out on top as the savior of both Pablo Escobar and his own legal career.

After the intense dialogue in court between Saul and the judge, the judge begins to weigh the options presented by Saul. He realizes that Saul's idea of negotiating peace between Pablo Escobar and the government could actually be a win-win situation for both sides. The judge decides to set up a meeting between Pablo and the government officials to discuss the terms of the peace agreement.

With the peace agreement in place, Pablo and his business continue to grow, and Saul continues to represent him as his lawyer. The two become close friends and trusted allies, as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of the criminal underworld together. Despite the risks and dangers, Saul remains steadfast in his commitment to helping Pablo and his business succeed, as he continues to hone his skills as one of the greatest lawyers in the world.

With Saul Goodman as his lawyer, Pablo is able to negotiate a peace agreement with the government that allows him to continue his business operations. He is then able to expand his empire and increase his wealth and influence. He uses his resources to bribe government officials and police, and to eliminate his enemies.

After signing a peace treaty, Pablo Escobar sets his sights on a new goal - to carry out a successful coup against the government. He sees this as the perfect opportunity to increase his power and influence, and to assert his dominance over the criminal underworld.

Pablo: Saul, we need to act fast. The government is getting too close, and they're starting to crack down on our operations.

Saul: I understand, Pablo. But a coup is a risky move. We need to be sure that we have all of our ducks in a row before we make a move.

Pablo: That's why I need you, Saul. Your legal expertise will be invaluable in making this happen. I have the muscle, but I need you to navigate the legal challenges and to make sure that everything is in order.

Saul: Alright, Pablo. Let's start with the basics. What's your endgame here? What do you want to achieve with this coup?

Pablo: I want power, Saul. I want to be the leader of this country, and I want to be able to operate my business without any interference from the government. I want to be in control.

Saul: I see. And what about the military and the police? How do we neutralize them?

Pablo: We have a network of loyal followers who are ready to take up arms on our behalf. We also have enough resources to bribe key officials and to neutralize any potential threats.

Saul: That's good, but we need to be sure that everything is done legally. We don't want to create any unnecessary problems for ourselves down the road.

Pablo: I trust you, Saul. You're the best in the business. Just make sure that everything is done according to the law, and that we have the support of the right people.

Saul: I'll take care of it, Pablo. We'll make this happen, and we'll come out on top.

With Saul Goodman as his lawyer, Pablo begins to put his plan into motion. He uses his vast network of contacts and resources to gather intelligence on government officials and to bribe key figures in the military and the police. He carefully cultivates a network of loyal followers who are ready to take up arms on his behalf.

As the coup nears, Pablo is ready to make his move. He launches a surprise attack on the government's headquarters, taking control of the key institutions and neutralizing any potential threats. With the government officials in disarray, Pablo declares himself the new leader of the country, and sets about consolidating his power and establishing his rule.

Despite opposition from some quarters, Pablo is able to successfully carry out the coup, and becomes the new leader of the country. He uses his resources and influence to maintain order, and to establish a new order in the criminal underworld. With Saul as his trusted advisor and legal expert, Pablo is able to navigate the challenges and opportunities of his new position, and to secure his place as one of the most powerful individuals in the world.

\---------------

EXTRA, Saul helps Pablo to become a senator.

Pablo: Saul, I need your help. The government is closing in on us, and I'm afraid we won't be able to keep our operations going much longer.

Saul: Don't worry, Pablo. That's what I'm here for. I'm the best damn lawyer in Albuquerque, and I've got a plan that's going to keep us out of hot water.

Pablo: What's the plan?

Saul: Well, first of all, I've been working on a new persona for you. From now on, you're not Pablo Escobar, the notorious drug lord. You're Pablo Escobar, the philanthropist.

Pablo (skeptical): The what?

Saul: The philanthropist! You're going to donate large sums of money to various charities and causes. It'll be great PR, and it'll show the world that you're not just a criminal, you're a humanitarian.

Pablo: And what if that doesn't work?

Saul (smiling): Then, we'll make you a senator.

Pablo (laughing): A senator? Saul, you're crazy!

Saul (chuckling): Hey, it worked for Al Capone.

And with that, Saul and Pablo continue to hatch their plan, using Saul's quick wit and humor to keep their spirits high and to find a way out of the sticky situation they find themselves in.

Saul walks into the senate chamber, straightening his tie and adjusting his lapel pin. He takes a deep breath and strides over to the podium, his eyes scanning the room as he approaches.

Senator: Mr. Goodman, what brings you here today?

Saul (grinning): Senator, I'm here to talk about a very important issue. An issue that affects us all. I'm here to talk about my client, Pablo Escobar.

Senator: Your client? The notorious drug lord?

Saul (waving his hand dismissively): Oh, please. Let's not get bogged down in labels. Pablo is a misunderstood man. He's a visionary. A man who wants to do good for his community.

Senator: And how do you propose we do that?

Saul (smiling): Well, Senator, that's where I come in. You see, I've been working on a plan. A plan that will not only help Pablo, but it will help the entire country.

Senator: And what is this plan?

Saul (leaning in conspiratorially): It's simple, Senator. We're going to make Pablo a senator.

Senator (skeptical): A senator?

Saul (nodding eagerly): That's right! Pablo has a lot to offer. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and he wants to use that to help his community. And what better way to do that than by serving in the senate?

Senator: But won't that just make him more powerful?

Saul (shrugging): Maybe. But he's already powerful. The difference is, now he'll be powerful for good. And I know that once you hear his vision, you'll see that he's the right man for the job.

And with that, Saul begins to lay out his plan, using his quick wit, humor, and charisma to sway the senators to his side. He's confident, he's charming, and he's a master at getting what he wants. In no time, the senators are laughing, nodding, and clapping, and Saul knows that he's got them right where he wants them.",i asked ChatGPT to write a story about Saul saving Pablo by making a peace treaty. it suggested Monopoly and controlled distribution.

1038,betterCallSaul,"Watching Better Call Saul, the one thing that felt great about the show is that it wasn't Breaking Bad. To me, it was just the story was a whole lot more reasonable. It had a slower pace, focused on developing these characters and developing the conditions and the conflict of the story. Jimmy was a much more sympathisable main character, and the show as a whole felt..  more realistic. Focused less on the badass stuff, and rather had me captivated for these characters. Don't get me wrong, many of the themes and scenes of Breaking Bad were enjoyable to me and I can't really say I didn't enjoy watching it, but I think it had a number of issues that Better Call Saul didn't have. But the personification of Breaking Bad's issues came in Season 5, presented as Eduardo Salamanca, otherwise known, very famously so, as Lalo. 

As I watched the few scenes introducing him, perhaps part of me didn't really despise him from the get-go. I was a bit worried about his personality, seemed a bit ""stereotypical guy who smiles as he does heinous evil stuff"", but I suppose I would just focus on seeing more from him. And then the episode ""Winner"" hits, which, if I could ignore Lalo existing, would probably be one of, if not my, favorite episodes. But this is where my dislike for this character started to.. grow.

As he follows Mike, eventually to find out about Werner, and he pays a visit to TravelWire, where he travels through the roof somehow completely flawlessly, (which, as anybody with any knowledge on these buildings would know, you could barely fit through there, let alone have one that could even handle human weight, LET ALONE MAKE NO NOISE, LET ALONE GET INTO WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING YOU) and murders Fred Wahlen upon reaching the other side with conveniently no witnesses, who would probably be more shocked by his physical capabilities than the fact that he murdered the man. This scene was just absurd but hey, at least he gets arrested for it. Much later than it should've happened, honestly.

Across the story, Lalo just acts like this.. dumbass ""psychopathic killer"" trope. He's there to look cool and be scary, he's there to smile as he kills people or does something fucked up and evil, and he did a lot of damage to my enjoyment of Season 5 and part of Season 6 to me. He doesn't have any motivations to care about unlike Gus. He doesn't have restrictions or limits unlike Nacho. He doesn't struggle with anything unlike Mike. He doesn't have anything that made him captivating, you know why? To me, it felt like all he was supposed to be was to be.. an absolutely unsympathetic un-understandable evil character who's there just to.. be evil. To be a bad guy, to be a central antagonist. And I despised it. Because with the rest of the show, which stayed feeling like an excellent story, he just felt so out of place, with the rest of the show that just had so much of my attention, hogged by this character that I didn't like at all. I really didn't like the Twins either for very similar reasons but I don't really care enough to write anything about them.

But that doesn't end my frustrations with Lalo. Not even close.

By far, possibly one of my least favorite episodes, and one of my least favorite moments -- is the shootout. When the mercenaries swamp the Salamanca compound, and everyone in the building is killed except Lalo. These are highly trained mercenaries, and yet the episode decides to stop being about a drama and suddenly shifted into an action movie. Where somehow Lalo is just.. smarter, better at shooting, than these well-trained mercenaries who have probably hit many people before, and he's just able to kill them all. Any other character in that situation would've been dead because they just don't have Lalo's magical abilities. I just despised how he's just somehow better than well-trained mercenaries because he's a central character and he's supposed to survive this moment. I was already spoiled on the fact that he dies before I watched this, so I knew he wasn't going to die here but I wish he did. And to me, the moments where he failed were genuinely the only good parts from him, to him being arrested, to him being killed by Gus (a much better character) -- it was the only things that felt real about his character.

I mean no insult to Tony Dalton, I think he was a fine actor. But I'm sorry about the character he had to play.

In conclusion, Lalo was just a dumb trope, a dumb character with magically better athletics and gun handling than literal trained mercenaries, and I just could not bring myself to enjoy his character. He contrasts poorly with the rest of the show and I felt angered everytime he was on screen.

I'm not gonna even mention how the fuck a wanted crimelord got to Germany and then back to America.","I didn't like Lalo Salamanca, at all. (LONG POST)"

1069,betterCallSaul,"I mean duh.
The whole draw of the show is seeing the origin of the funny lawyer man from Breaking Bad, among other things. The writers aren't going to try and act like they can just make a prequel show and not expect it to get spoiled by their very popular previous show.

Many characters are given dramatic entrances. Like the scene where Mike first sees Los Pollos Hermanos, the music is all tense and everything because you the audience member know who's about to show up. Or Hector's first scene, or how they hide Hank's face for a bit, even though in just the context of BCS he's a random DEA agent who's only in two episodes. Even fucking Gale's first appearance is somewhat dramatic.

Breaking Bad introduces these characters normally because, at the time in the eyes of the viewer, these guys were just people. Los Pollos Hermanos was just a restaurant before Gus reveals himself.
 You're supposed to already know why Jimmy's working at a Cinnabon, the significance of fucking Gale, and what exactly went down that made Gus so pissed without piecing together random lines from different episodes and finding out from a casually delivered ""Oh my uncle shot his boyfriend in the head"". 

Hell the finale where Jimmy confesses his sins had way more weight when you've seen the shit he's done in Breaking Bad.

Tuco's first appearance works better when you've seen Breaking Bad and know how crazy that MF is while his first scene in Breaking Bad showed how violent he and the finale being a shock to see him beat a dude to death over that. Meanwhile, in BCS we only hear of that kind of methed up crazy from Nacho while Tuco is much more lowkey during his actual screen time.

The only argument I could kind of get is the scenes where characters from BB are in danger and it raises tension. But that doesn't really happen often. Jimmy is the main character so we know he wasn't dying during Bagman either way, there was always tension with Nacho. Mike doesn't participate in many life-threatening shootouts or anything. Even when he got stabbed you wouldn't expect that to be his character death. I don't see why anybody would really care about Gus dying during his confrontation with Lalo, it was a fight between two villains, and the intriguing part is wondering how Gus makes it out alive since you know he doesn't die there.

And get the fuck out of here with ""watch the whole series until the 5th to last episode, then watch five seasons of Breaking Bad, El Camino and *then* finish up BCS"". 

It's not an insult to the show or any lesser than Breaking Bad because of this. Shrek 2 is the best Shrek movie but watching it before the first would just be stupid. Same with Godfather II, or The Dark Knight, or the Empire Strikes Back.",The show was clearly created with the idea that the audience already saw Breaking Bad.

His dad is obviously pissed off at him the rest of the show but I assumed it was due to the drugs being exposed to him period.

1095,betterCallSaul,"When Mike refuses to use Nacho's father as leverage for Gus in the cabin, Tyrus immediately starts waving his gun around and says ""say the word"" as if he'd legit shoot Mike based on basically nothing.

I didn't pay it much mind at first but on rewatch it seems really out of nowhere and kind of sloppy. We obviously know all 3 of these guys survive the scene so I'm not riding that, but even if I didn't know that, it'd be bizarre if Mike were actually shot. He didn't do or even say anything offensive enough to earn it. 

He'd disagreed with or straight up went out of his way to disobey or get in Gus' way before and this interaction falls in line with the others. And Tyrus has been portrayed as pretty well collected and like Mike that he wouldn't jump to violence that quick. At a reach that'd be a Victor move, and even then the circumstances wouldn't make sense. Even Gus allowing Tyrus to hold the gun on Mike for ages felt out of character for him too.

If Mike had shown his gun in his belt or raised his voice then I guess that'd be aggressive but he's pretty political in it.",Tyrus' reaction was a bit much.

Saul's adverts are cheesy and lazy. They have terrible acting, the camera work is terrible and hell they even added the typical 'Sexy police woman' (to be fair, that was quite common on adverts in the early 2000s).

Why is this? Honestly, I may be grasping at straws, but I think this was intentional. In the early seasons, Jimmy was passionate about being a lawyer. Surprisingly enough, the moment he made the D.A.M advert, he immediately showed Kim. He always wanted to impress her. 

But now that Kim is gone, Jimmy doesn't have to care. He's basically Gene as Saul, but putting on a persona. He's empty inside.

1158,betterCallSaul,"I'm a native Spanish speaker, and I know how memeticly bad some of the Hispanic/Mexican/Latino accents in this universe are. 

That being said, I can't help but notice that Hector's (or, rather, Mark Margolis') accent during his meeting with Mike had almost a Caribbean flavour. 

Granted, I'm South American, but, to me, Hector almost sounded like a Cuban man that just recently learned how to speak English, particularly when he said: ""Tomorrow, you go to the DA, and you explain to him that my nephew's gun was yours. Make up anything you want, I don't give a shit"".

What's more, when Hector said: ""Se los dije: tiene unos huevotes"", I could almost believe that he was a Mexican citizen that simply spent too much time in the US and started to lose some of his original accent.

Just my two cents about that scene; I know how bad Hector's Spanish was in other parts of both series.",Something funny about Hector's accent I noticed in 2x06...

1175,betterCallSaul,"Been having lots of fun with ChatGPT to outline spinoffs from various shows.    This is one really cracks me up though.

\---

The spinoff series would follow the adventures of Daniel Wormald, the small-time thief who became a major player in Albuquerque's criminal underworld. The series would open with Daniel as a young man, running a successful laser tag business and making a name for himself as a cunning and resourceful criminal.

As the series progresses, we would see Daniel delve deeper into the world of illegal pharmaceuticals, using his connections with Nacho Varga to build a thriving drug-dealing operation. Despite the constant threat of police attention and rival gangs, Daniel proves to be a master of his trade, using his clever mind and quick reflexes to stay one step ahead of his enemies.

Despite his success, however, Daniel is never content to simply rest on his laurels. He is constantly looking for new opportunities, and soon finds himself drawn into the world of high-stakes crime, taking on riskier and more dangerous jobs to expand his criminal empire.

Along the way, we would see Daniel struggle to balance his criminal activities with his personal life, as he tries to maintain his relationship with his family and friends, and keep his true identity as ""The Squat Cobbler"" a secret from those closest to him.

With its complex characters, intricate plotlines, and pulse-pounding action, this spinoff series would provide a fresh and exciting take on the world of Better Call Saul, and offer a compelling look at the life of one of its most intriguing characters. Whether he is facing down the police, outwitting rival gangs, or simply trying to stay one step ahead of his own conscience, Daniel Wormald is a character that audiences won't soon forget.",Daniel Wormold spinoff as predicted by ChatGPT
1176,betterCallSaul,"In the next season of Better Call Saul, Saul Goodman continues to adjust to life in prison. As he tries to make the best of his situation, he becomes increasingly involved in the politics of the prison, using his legal expertise to help his fellow prisoners and protect them from the corrupt prison system.

Despite the danger, Saul becomes a respected figure within the prison community and gains a reputation as a fearless advocate for those who cannot stand up for themselves. However, this newfound power and influence also attracts the attention of the prison guards and other powerful figures within the criminal underworld.

As Saul navigates the dangerous and unpredictable world of prison life, he is forced to confront his past and the mistakes that led him to where he is today. He begins to question whether he is truly happy with the life he has chosen and whether he will ever be able to reclaim his old life as a successful criminal lawyer.

At the same time, the outside world continues to change, as Jimmy McGill transforms into Saul Goodman and the events of Breaking Bad begin to unfold. Saul must struggle to stay connected to the world outside and to his former life, even as he becomes increasingly entrenched in the world of prison life.

The next season of Better Call Saul is a thrilling and emotionally charged journey through the criminal underworld, as Saul Goodman tries to navigate the dangerous and unpredictable world of prison life and come to terms with the mistakes of his past.",ChatGPT leaks the next season of Better Call Saul

I'm referring to Saul deciding to go confess, and get a higher sentence. The first time he had mentioned he wanted to give the court system more information was at the mention of Kim. Saul knew that Kim was going to be in trouble with Howard's wife, and upon hearing this, he told his lawyer at the time that he wanted to divulge more informatino to the court.

&amp;#x200B;

But when push came t shove, what I thought was going to happen, was that he was goign to take the fall for Kim somehow, and save her from litigation. But that wasn't mentioned in the court room at all. Nothing, to my understanding, saved Kim from litigation at all. So why did he decide to do this? My gut is that he wanted to come clean, because he knew that living a life as a free man after 7 years wouldn't have made him truly satisfied, because he would have gained that freedom through another con, which makes total sense. But why then did he only think aobut this after his lawyer had mentioned that detail about Kim?

Saul has alluded multiple times to a negative opinion of rich, as someone who is stuck up and elitist (e.g howard by a different name season 2, a bunch of stuffed shirts right before the tell me again scene).

1269,betterCallSaul,"I prefer seasons 5 and 6 over the rest but am curious to hear what this sub has to think. 5 gets so much done in the grand scheme of things in regards to what the show is trying to pull off, and it is the official beginning of Saul Goodman as a lawyer and establishes Saul as a friend of the cartel. Kim's morality falls the most in these seasons due the groundwork the show built with her becoming addicted to the scams and resenting Howard (and those like him) more and more. The final season manages to tie up every loose end within the show in a satisfying way while also telling its own amazing story. 

Seasons 1-3 are great and arguably the most important in the show. These seasons tell a unique story focused on two brothers and a rivalry filled with resentment and betrayal. Season 4 is like a buffer zone. Jimmy isn't practicing law and is recovering (in his own unhealthy way) from the loss of Chuck, but he also manages to begin building his client base by selling cell phones. It's a necessary but slow part of the show. 

All of the seasons are good, but 6 is my personal favorite because of how everything was concluded. The final season had a lot on it's shoulders, Nacho, Howard, Lalo, setting up the BB characters, finishing Jimmy and Kim's story arcs. The season seemed to have so much on it's plate but still held up to the quality that we had become accustomed to.

I used to think so, but this last season and especially the flashbacks of Jimmy asking Mike and Walt about their regrets have left me in doubt. It doesn't really seem like he had a turning point to becoming Slipping Jimmy/Saul Goodman. I felt like he'd always been that way and that there was nothing he could have done to change that. 

What are your thoughts on this? Could his brother's forgiveness and trust have led him down a different path or was Chuck right all along and Jimmy was really a lost cause?",Was Chuck right all along?

1295,betterCallSaul,"I recently finished the show, and while I largely enjoyed it, I felt like the scene after Kim breaks up with Jimmy where we finally see his full transformation into the sleazy lawyer we know from Breaking Bad was a bit heavy-handed in its depiction of the character. It just felt a bit inauthentic, in they wanted to show his moral descent but it was so profound that he seemed like more of a caricature than a human being.

I mean, waking up with a hooker in his bed, immediately picking up the phone to start threatening people? The thing that I thought was way over the top was that he parked in a handicap spot even though the whole parking lot in front of his office was empty. Overall it just felt like the writers went way over the top with the character and his actions during the scene.

1308,betterCallSaul,"It baffles me that some people are saying that Jimmy deciding to come clean and not take the 7 years in prison ruined his character and the ending. I just don't understand that logic. 

Think about it. What would Jimmy have done once the 7 years was up? He has no family, no friends, his reputation is scorched beyond repair and he wouldn't be able to practice law ever again. What quality of life would he have after he was released? 

In my opinion, the worst thing Jimmy had ever done was what happened to Howard. When he learned that Kim had given an affidavit to Howard's widow, it caused all those guilty feelings to resurface. Howard Hamlin, a widely respected lawyer at a successful, prestigious law firm that his brother built, was not only dead because of him, but his legacy was shattered due to Jimmy framing him to be a coke addict that took his own life. Not only that, but Howard's body will never be found. Not even Jimmy knows where he's buried. He also destroyed and corrupted Kim. Sure, Kim was flawed to start with, but Jimmy only escalated her transformation into Slippin' Kimmy. This led to people getting hurt and killed. Jimmy helped make Kim who she was. 

Jimmy realized that he can't keep lying. Like Chuck says, ""Jimmy this is what you do. You hurt people over and over and over."" Prison is where he belongs. He spent years scamming, lying and cheating his way through life. It was time for him to stop running. It was time for him to accept what he had done, because even once he's released from prison after 7 years, his life was already over. Had he taken the 7 years, I wouldn't have been surprised if he just committed suicide upon his release. 

God damn, it was a perfect ending to his character. It just surprised me how many people thought it was stupid of Jimmy to turn down the 7 years. What are your thoughts?",I don't get why people were mad with Jimmy not taking the 7 years?

In 3x07, Jimmy proposes she get him drunk, and they sell someone a credit card for $5,000.

In this case, Kim can sense that he probably would have kept the money, this time.

Is the reason why didn't want to run the scam, because she was still upset about how they publicly tore down Chuck?  And she thought there might have been a more humane way to defend Jimmy at the bar hearing, but not tear down Chuck?

So she was still distressed over that?

Or is it because Jimmy was pushing it farther with the scam this time, by actually getting himself drunk, and most likely keeping the money they would have scammed?

Or because she sensed he was still affected by the events of 3x05 with what happened with Chuck, even though he said that he had put it in his rear view mirror, and wasn't thinking about Chuck anymore?

1341,betterCallSaul,,It's probably the coolest piece I own now!
1342,betterCallSaul,"I don't know if anyone has caught this yet, but I just noticed this on a rewatch. When Jimmy is asking Kim to print all of the case law that relates to his Sandpiper investigation, he suggests that she use Howard's billing code for the printing. He remembers that the code is 1933, which is the same year that Hitler came to power. When she refuses, Jimmy runs inside and convinces Chuck to let him use his code, which is 1868.

So what is significant about 1868? Well, it happens to be the year that the 14th Amendment was ratified.  The 14th Amendment is one of the most consequential constitutional amendments to modern politics and many high-profile legal battles, and Charles ""One after Magna Carta"" McGill would know that. It deals with concepts such as naturalized citizenship, due process, and equal protection under the law. The principles of ""fairness"" enshrined in this Amendment are basically what Chuck purports to love about the law and why he seeks to defend it from Jimmy's ""wolves and sheep"" worldview.

By the way, do you know what else happened in 1933? The 21st Amendment was ratified that year, which effectively brought an end to Prohibition. The in-universe explanation for this is probably that it is a humorous inside joke from Howard, but it may also be some subtle foreshadowing from the writers about how Jimmy and Kim eventually take him down.",Billing code Easter eggs from Season 1
1343,betterCallSaul,"Kim is such a babe that I can‚Äôt help but wonder how she never considered breaking things off with Jimmy and going out with a financially secure, less problematic and ‚Äúalways down‚Äù man. 

Early in the series we get little info about any prior lovers she was involved with. Once they start hitting it off, their relationship is never romantically tested. It‚Äôs like Jimmy has no competition. I get Kim is kind of intimidating and likely curves a lot of guys, but was she never attracted to anyone else than Jimmy during the show? Even through Jimmy‚Äôs tainted reputation and constant shortcomings? Do women like this exist??

Kim is great because she empathizes with Jimmy‚Äôs situation with Chuck so much, which makes her on Team Jimmy for that case, bringing them even closer together. Also I get her kryptonite is the rush of conning with Jimmy, and that experience is what holds them together. A great scene is Kim at the bar calling Jimmy to help her con the guy that is hitting on her. That scene kind of summarizes them as a couple.",Kim Wexler is way out of Jimmy‚Äôs league

I saw a lot of people here complaining about Lalo's death saying that it was underwhelming and I get that, BUT there weren't ANY plot holes related to it. Lalo dispersed Mike, his biggest achievement, got the information about the lab and was going to finally reveal it to Eladio, who would then kill Gus. 

What really saved Gus was his sixth sense to go in the lab at that moment and his balls. Gus going there by his own was the only way Lalo could be defeated. Let's say he sent Mike there: Mike wouldn't even see Lalo, but because he's Mike let's suppose he got there in time, Lalo knows Mike and knows what he's capable of, Lalo wouldn't subestimate him like he did with Gus and (I'm ready for the downvotes) kill Mike. 

Now, we know Mike is badass, prepared, experienced and highly skilled, but when we are talking about Lalo we are talking about the twins level (mfs killed like 100 guys in S4). Lalo knew the place he was in, so Mike wouldn't have any advantages besides his men, but counting the fact that he would lead them, Mike would certainly either die or get severely injured. Lalo seeing Mike surrounding him would probably do some crazy shit like hopping in a roof, shoot 5 guys in a row, take their guns, do some parkour, it would be crazy but I'd say Lalo would certainly either scape or really kill them all. 

I know that for something like that to happen in such a realistic universe like the one in BCS would be strange and that's why it didn't happen.

Lalo's death was just a quick shootout where two men fired randomly in the dark, Gus the mastermind criminal really went where his enemy was fully knowing of Lalo's capability and was incredibly close to dying (he did the same mistake in Breaking Bad), Mike with prep time was outplayed, and Lalo, the unstoppable force of nature, died by the hands of the ""chicken man"". English is not my first language.

TLDR: Lalo's plan was perfect, Mike would've died by his hands if Gus wasn't there, Gus got away because of random luck.",Lalo's plan was perfect and Gus was lucky

Wondering if I missed something here.

When Mike's daughter-in-law complains about the safety of their neighborhood, he sits outside her house all night in his car to see if anything happens. The night is uneventful and in the morning, Mike goes home.

Then his daughter-in-law calls to say there was a gunshot during the night and shows him where a bullet supposedly grazed the outside of the house. He knows there was no shooting that night.

At this point I thought his daughter-in-law was trying to scam Mike for money. She had previously made comments about how she had all these bills, etc.

Mike gets her the new house, but they never come back to this and while Mike has a soft spot in any sort of fatherly role, he is never fooled(especially by something so obvious) and I thought they might make more of this.

Jimmy is constantly negotiating and arguing from a place of disepowerment, which means that all of his greatest victories are won through emotional manipulation/persuasion rather than violence.

 Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWKkOz-hXpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWKkOz-hXpg) 

I love this, the dance of Jimmy's argumentation is enthralling and tense in a way I've never seen in any other piece of art. It's something I've been inspired by too, and I've been working to emulate in my most recent work. I'm working on a choices-matter narrative video game where the player must try to survive as a weak and old doctor after an exile to an underground cave. I think this community will find it evocative as I've made it an explicit goal of the game for players to be able to resolve conflict through reasoning, logic, and understanding of psychology instead of violence. Please take a look!

1400,betterCallSaul,"I don‚Äôt think many people will need this but, Breaking Bad (and BCS obviously) spoilers coming


Onto the obvious first:

-Jimmy has the saddest ending out of anyone in Breaking Bad, his life as Gene was already depressing enough, but his ending actually made me cry seeing an already broken man being torn to his last bits (not saying it was underserved, it‚Äôs just tragic to see the character we know and love like that)

-Howard gets the most undeservedly tragic ending, I actually quite liked him and him being killed in cold blood with his reputation ruined was heartbreaking, he was just a victim of a family feud and Jimmy‚Äôs ego. And to add onto it, knowing that they cooked over his dead body (buried with his murderer) in Breaking Bad makes it so much more sinister.

Also I was uncomfortable with every single scene where they plotted against Howard, it really took was an effort to sit through those scenes.

-Kim was too perfect for Jimmy, and as she said that‚Äôs why they broke up, they complimented each other *too* perfectly

Moving onto things of which I don‚Äôt know the popularity here:

-Chuck was right about Jimmy, but as much as he scolded him for ‚Äúusing the ends to justify the means‚Äù his whole tape thing was the perfect example of that. He knew Jimmy as a Lawyer was dangerous, but the way he brought him down was the most ineffective at it.

-Jimmy was not even near as bad as Walter White, it‚Äôs just that Breaking Bad does a much better job at gaslighting everyone about Walt‚Äôs actions, unlike him.

Jimmy was incredibly self aware, and did really care about Kim above anything, unlike Walt who justified his actions as helping his family, but actually did it for himself.",Just finished BCS and here some observations and thoughts I‚Äôve held onto for a while
1401,betterCallSaul,"Many claim that Walter White was a destructive agent for the criminal underworld; he ruined Gustavo Fring's drug empire (and anyone associated with it, as shown by his killing of Michael Ehrmantraut, the 10 people in prison, and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle), Jack Welker's gang, and Saul Goodman's life. This is true; however, the Breaking Bad Universe has two other main characters who could be considered destructive agents: Saul Goodman and Gustavo Fring.

**Walter White:** Walter White was a true Machiavellian; he befriended and befoed people based on his personal interests. He befriended Jesse Pinkman to give him an entry into the criminal underworld. He befriended Gustavo Fring for security, and he killed Gustavo Fring for his personal interests of safety and ambition. He befriended Saul Goodman for legal and business advice. He befriended Lydia Rodarte-Quayle to keep his methamphetamine empire running. For his interest of tying up loose ends, he killed Lydia Rodarte-Quayle and the entirely of Jack Welker's gang. Purely for his personal ambition, he continued selling methamphetamine after killing Gustavo Fring even though he had enough money to survive and even though Michael Ehrmantraut had enough money to bribe the 10 people in prison to keep themselves quiet. **Because of Walter White's Machiavellianism, the entire New Mexico drug trade was permanently damaged.**

**Saul Goodman:** Unlike Walter White, whose destructive tendencies were fueled by Machiavellianism, Saul Goodman's destructive tendencies were fueled by anti-establishmentarianism. Initially, this manifested in minor ways, such as forcing Clifford Main to fire him from Davis and Main, but as time progresses, his destructive tendencies become more prominent. By faux crying to the insurance company, he indirectly causes his brother, Charles McGill, to knock over a gas lantern, killing himself. Later Saul Goodman, along with Kimberly Wexler, executes a series of elaborate scams to defame Howard Hamlin, eventually leading to Howard Hamlin's death and the downsizing of Hamlin-Hamlin-McGill; the motivations behind this are Saul Goodman's antiestablishment hatred of Howard Hamlin and his greed (he wanted the Sandpiper money). Even though Saul Goodman never intended to destroy the New Mexico drug trade, during the *Breaking Bad* era Saul Goodman's anti-establishmentarianism attracted many despicable clients, such as Walter White, who ultimately caused the destruction of Gustavo Fring's and Jack Welker's drug empires. **Whether directly or indirectly, unintentionally or intentionally, Saul Goodman's anti-establishment inclinations permanently damaged the Albuquerque legal industry and the New Mexico drug trade.**

**Gustavo Fring:** Gustavo Fring, while superficially associated with the Cartel, hated every high-ranking member: Eladio Vuente, Juan Bolsa, and especially Hector Salamanca. Ever since Hector Salamanca killed Maximino Archiniega, Gustavo Fring slowly destroyed the Cartel. First, he urged Michael Ehrmantraut to continue robbing Hector Salamanca's trucks, cutting his business, which ultimately gave Hector Salamanca a stroke. Later, he ordered the failed assassination of Eduardo Salamanca, and then he killed Eduardo Salamanca in his methamphetamine lab. He ordered Marco and Leonel Salamanca to kill Henry Schrader, only to inform Henry Schrader of the attack. Not only did this cause the deaths of Marco and Leonel Salamanca, it also caused Juan Bolsa to die after unwanted attention from federales. During the events of ""Salud"", Gustavo Fring gave poisoned tequila to almost every remaining member of the Cartel, causing Hector Salamanca to be the only Cartel boss left. Gustavo Fring ultimately died with Hector Salamanca in a suicide bombing. Throughout both shows, Gustavo Fring was motivated by revenge. **Gustavo Fring's revenge caused him to destroy the Cartel, permanently damaging the New Mexico drug trade.**","Walter White, Saul Goodman, and Gustavo Fring as destructive agents"

1406,betterCallSaul,"What was their obsession with Howard being a sex addict? First, Jimmy sets him up with 2 prostitutes and tries to make him look like a philandering horndog. Then, they ambush Howard in the change room at the golf club where men are naked, making Howard blush with embarrassment around naked men which would make them think he's down bad. Finally (and this is the most convoluted) they made Howard look like he was obsessed with the elderly judge with the broken arm. They made it look like Howard had him followed and had pictures taken of him, clearly implying that Howard is severely into GILFS (""grandpas I'd like to fuck""). I don't understand. How does implying Howard to be a sex addict somehow release the Sandpiper money? And why did Howard commit suicide because of it?",Why did Jimmy and Kim try to prove that Howard is a nymphomaniac?

What do you think? How would you do it?",Rewatching BCS and BB Which order?
1408,betterCallSaul,"Before I continue, yes I realize every character is depressing in a sense such as seeing Jimmy be completely immoral in BB, but for some odd reason it just hits hard with me on Mike‚Äôs part. BB Spoilers of course. 




I would also like to mention that Mike in BCS is by no means a good guy and is still a criminal, but yeah‚Ä¶





In BCS Mike still has a code, he hates having civilians in the wildfire and is willing to die for Papa Varga‚Äôs protection, then he is super upset at having to kill Werner who was such a good man with the wrong crowd. 





He also really loves Kaylee too and you feel like him being a grandpa and father that he‚Äôd have a soft spot for kids especially those younger than him like Nacho. 





But watching BB I‚Äôm like ‚Äúholy shit this is not the Mile I know‚Ä¶‚Äù Mike is so deep in the crime game that all those morales are now gone, now Mike is just all about business. 






Victor gets killed by Gus? Mike is shocked at first but then nonchalantly perishes his body like nothing, a man he‚Äôs worked with for years. He also still works for Gus despite that chance that he could be in Victor‚Äôs position. 





Mike threatens to kill Lydia in front of her own daughter (I‚Äôm totally with Mike on killing Lydia but to say that you don‚Äôt want your daughter to see her mom‚Äôs dead body is pretty fucking cold, especially murdered and shot).




Mike is less caring about innocent civilians, he still leaves them alone but he wouldn‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre in the crossfire or not. 





Mike left Kaylee by herself at the park but to be fair he was pretty fucked in the situation due to the DEA.




And finally, the one thing that bugged me the most and what made me make this post. Mike has zero fucks when Todd kills that kid and that‚Äôs when I lost all my respect for Mike. 




I‚Äôm over here thinking that he‚Äôd get pissed at Todd and fight with Walter and be on Jesse‚Äôs side‚Ä¶ but instead he sides with Walt? You can sense it in him too, he genuinely does not care that the kid got killed and seems comfortable knowing that a potential witness is gone. And to put icing on the cake, he get‚Äôs on Todd‚Äôs ass not because of him nochantly murdering a child but because he brought a gun to the job without Mike‚Äôs knowledge. 







In BCS you can at least feel for Mike, but in BB he‚Äôs just this cold hearted person with zero remorse.",Seeing Mike in BB after finishing BCS is so depressing.
1409,betterCallSaul,"I was rewatching breaking bad and realized in Saul‚Äôs first appearance E8 Season 2, he introduces the idea to Walt and Jessie to have a fall man to cover their tracks.

This fall man was James Kilkelly, who Saul said specifically does this because he enjoys prison and feels more comfortable than the outside world.

I find this to be a neat indirect reference to Saul‚Äôs fate, as he also realizes he‚Äôs far more comfortable in prison. They also both share the name Jimmy, which is a neat detail. Ik this couldn‚Äôt have been planned originally but it does kinda fit neatly together.",Is Jimmy Kilkelly an indirect reference to Saul Goodman?
1410,betterCallSaul,"I am so confused about this part. First, as Nacho said, Hector forgot about this person and already got what he wanted, which was getting Tuco out sooner. Their business was settled. Yes, Hector knows there is a badass guy in the town. But if you rewatch their first meeting, Hector was really humble(His criteria). He knows Tuco would hit a man for almost no reason. Things move on. Mike just played fire for no reason, what if he missed? This is not the Mike way. If he needs money, he should split the Kettleman money. More and easier. 

Or as Nacho said in the plot, Mike wanted to lead the police to Hector. He could do much better. First, since he took the money, even if he left some. Transporting a lot of cash is not a big felony. Why didn't he rob a drag truck? And why didn't he call the police just like he did with Tuco? Don't you tell me he hope random people would report this? Or he could report Hector to the police and DEA when they are in the car repair shop. More efficient and easier, and Hector will definitely rot in jail for sure.    

I don't want to call it a flaw. But this part really makes me confused",Why did Mike rob Hecotor's truck? For money or what?

1--&gt; He did not attend a regular/good school but an online/no-name one.

2--&gt; He was and always going to be Slippin Jimmy who did not fit in with the company's image.

I think the 2nd factor was much more important to Chuck but I'm curious of your opinion on the first one too.

I too was a terrible student so all I could attend was a pretty crappy college (not online thankfully) and I see people from the best colleges look out for those college names when hiring. I understand why but I do not understand why inferior college graduates have to be degraded like this.
So what if I was not good before?  Couldn't I get on a similar level WHILE IN COLLEGE?
I'm not studying law but it seemed to me like Jimmy was on the same or similar level as most of the lawyers working at HHM. He got there by himself and not by his school name or some teachers or his money or whatever.

1422,betterCallSaul,,Easy..
1423,betterCallSaul,,Better Call Saul - Season 6 [Blu-ray] is NOW (39% OFF!!!) on Amazon!
1424,betterCallSaul,"In the last three episodes of the show, the writers have to deal with...

1. Gene's story
2. Appearances of Saul Goodman (doesn't feel right to have Saul only appear in one scene in a show titled ""Better Call Saul"")
3. Explaining Saul's role in Breaking Bad (the show was clearly meant to be standalone), complete with appearances of Walt and Jesse
4. Kim's story

Three episodes does not look like nearly enough time to deal with this. But the writers manage anyways by deciding to make the Gene story a metaphor for the Saul story. By making Gene's story parallel Saul's, we get to see how Saul Goodman adds to Jimmy's arc without the excruciating pain of watching Saul Goodman himself, given how nauseating it is to watch someone pretend to be content for an extended period of time knowing it's all bullshit. That one scene in 6x9 was hard enough to go through, and presenting Saul in the body of Gene solves this problem because Gene puts up less of a facade. He may not express his trauma any more than Saul does, but he at least shows it, making him an easier character to watch. Making Gene represent Saul in his own dull, black-and-white Nebraskan world also helps us see Saul Goodman for what he really was...a walking corpse of a man rather than the comedy sidetrack we knew him as in BrBa. And it's satisfying to see two priorities knocked down at once-- bringing new viewers up to speed while informing BrBa viewers of how Gene's arc continues.

Jimmy isn't a bad enough person to deserve death, but has also hurt enough people to not deserve to go scot-free...prison is the only justified ending for him, but it feels wrong to send him there after already putting him through countless years of mental hell. The only ending that feels right is to send him to prison while also ensuring that mental hell is cured. And it can only be cured by someone new Jimmy meets, which will not feel rewarding since ""someone new"" would mean introducing someone out of left field, or Kim. Thus, the ending should have Jimmy going to prison but Kim curing Jimmy's mental hell. As per Jimmy's arc, this would mean rekindling their relationship in some capacity.

Gene's story parallelling Saul's means Gene will automatically do something that leads to him going to prison, so how Jimmy ends up in prison isn't an issue. What needs to be considered is what Kim can do to make Jimmy realize, after he ends up with the authorities, that he has the opportunity to rekindle their relationship. However Kim presents this opportunity to Jimmy also has to be a part of her own arc and her own story, since she's practically an independent character at this point in the show.

The writers decide to make this play out by connecting the ""November phone call w/Francesca"" scene in 4x5 to Gene finding out Kim cared enough about him to ask if he was alive. Since Gene's story is meant to parallel Saul's, this call ends with Kim making him feel ""not good enough to be with her"" the same way she made Jimmy feel ""not good enough"" in 6x9, causing him to become Saul. The writers decide to make this happen by making her tell him to turn himself in, with the knowledge that this can be interpreted as Kim preaching down to Jimmy or Kim telling him to turn himself in out of concern for the life he's living and out of concern for his happiness (she doesn't know the extent of his crimes and has no reason not to believe the life he's living isn't worse than prison).

To complete the ending, the writers have to tie Kim telling him to turn himself in into her own story while also finding a way to make Jimmy find out she wasn't preaching down to him and was telling him to turn himself in out of love. Since Kim's arc is driven by a need to make her own decisions and form her own identity, it makes sense that her ""punishment"" should be forcing herself to make no decisions at all, which would obviously kill her on the inside. The writers connect the fact that Walter killed the entire cartel off to let Jimmy inform Kim that she can confess to her role in Howard's murder, which gives viewers an ending to Mike and Gus' arcs while also providing a climax to her arc by giving her the opportunity to feel like herself again by making a decision she wants to make and knows can't hurt others, thus finally allowing her to regain her self-esteem and with it, her identity...not too much for her punishment to be undone, but enough to help her climb out of her own mental hell and seek the legal aid volunteering opportunity. This provides the dual function of letting Jimmy know, when the DA tells her she confessed, that she wasn't preaching down to him to feel better about herself and told him to turn himself in out of love.

This brings us to the end of the show, where Jimmy gets to escape his mental hell by facing his traumas and regain his identity, now empowered to do so with the knowledge that he might receive Kim's affection in return, while also ensuring he receives his deserved consequence of prison time.

All in all, this show ties together what happened with Chuck (Jimmy initially seeing Kim as Chuck 2.0 for telling him to turn himself in), with the story of Jimmy becoming Saul, with Breaking Bad, with the Francesca phone call scene and with Kim to create an ending that feels contrived but makes absolute sense. The first nine episodes of the season are good, but these last few episodes and their brilliant connecting of dots is what makes the season brilliant.",Last 3 episodes of the show are sooooooooo underrated and a masterclass in connecting seemingly distant dots to create a story that shocks you and feels right at the same time

Episode 2 was great, but that was almost solely because of Tuco and Nacho. *That* was of the level. But of course the show soon reverts back to its excruciatingly slow and boring courtroom hoohah.

Also, trying to buy the scenes with a 60 year old Bob Odenkirk and an 80 year old Jonathan Banks trying to depict guys in their 20s and 30s/40s respectively *really* takes me out of it.

I thought Saul is a great supporting character in BB and Odenkirk plays him brilliantly. But as a *lead*? Fuck no. Same as Jesse in El Camimo.

1430,betterCallSaul,"Better Call Saul is a carefully crafted and meticulously produced show, and reducing its characters, themes, and events to the level of a cheap joke or a one-liner is an insult to the hard work and dedication of those involved in bringing it to life. By making memes about the show, one is effectively saying that its content is not worthy of serious consideration or that its value lies only in the potential for humor.

Also, the show is a deeply personal and emotional journey for many fans, who have grown to love the characters, the writing, and the world of the show. For these fans, making memes about the show can be hurtful and disrespectful because it treats their favorite show and its characters with less reverence than they deserve. It sends the message that the show's creators and its fans are not serious or intelligent enough to appreciate its subtlety and nuance, and that the only way to engage with the show is through humor.

It's also important to consider the impact that memes can have on the larger cultural conversation about a show. Memes can quickly become viral and widely shared, and in doing so, they can shape public perceptions and attitudes towards a particular subject. By making memes about BCS, one is contributing to a culture that values humor over substance, and that prioritizes cheap laughs over meaningful and insightful commentary.

Finally, the subject matter of the memes can be disrespectful to the cast as well. Memes about the sexualization of some characters as well as misrepresenting them does not give the actors the respect they deserve for having part in such an influential and important show.

His other nephews, Leonel and Marco, were Cartel hitmen. They all acted very professionally; they certainly gave the ""cartel boss"" vibes. We do not see much of Joaquin, so he can pretty much be ignored here.

Tuco, on the other hand, definitely does not give off ""cartel boss"" vibes; he gives off ""street dealer"" vibes. He is probably the only Salamanca who actually tries the product he sells, and he is extremely aggressive, definitely not professional. I would be interested to see if Vince Gilligan has an explanation for why Tuco turned out the way he did; obviously, Tuco being a meth addict is probably why he is so aggressive, but WHY is Tuco a meth addict? None of the other Salamancas were.

(The crowd is going wild as the entrance music for Saul Goodman, aka Jimmy McGill, aka ""The Con Artist"" starts to play. Saul makes his way down to the ring, wearing a flashy suit and carrying a microphone.)

Saul:
Ladies and Gentlemen, the one and only, Saul Goodman has arrived!

(The crowd roars in approval as Saul steps into the ring and begins to address the audience.)

Saul:
Now, I know what you're all thinking. You're thinking, ""Saul, why are you here in the WWE?"" Well, let me tell you, I have a score to settle with my old friend, Lalo Salamanca.

(Lalo's entrance music starts to play, and he makes his way down to the ring, looking menacing as usual.)

Lalo:
What do you want, Saul? I don't have time for your games.

Saul:
Oh, Lalo, Lalo, Lalo. You always were one for getting straight to the point. But let me tell you, I've got a proposition for you. A one-on-one match, right here, right now.

Lalo:
You think you can take me down, Saul? I'm the king of this ring.

Saul:
King? More like the jester, if you ask me. But I'll give you a shot, Lalo. I'll give you the chance to prove yourself.

(The crowd goes wild as Saul and Lalo square off, ready for a no-holds-barred, winner-takes-all match. The two begin to trade blows, with Saul using his quick wit and cunning to try and get the upper hand. However, Lalo proves to be a formidable opponent, and the match goes back and forth. In the end, it all comes down to one final move, as Saul pulls out his ""Con Artist Special"" and takes Lalo down for the three-count, becoming the undisputed champion of the WWE ring.

2. Commercial shooting scene at the school where the staff try to stop Jimmy but he concocts a story about obtaining permission from higher authorities. He stands in front of the flag and gets his shot.
3. The courtroom scene with Lalo where they hire a fake family and present it as Lalo's family. The prosecutor rolls her eyes when Jimmy introduces the family to the jury.
4. (Season 6 spoiler) Bill Oakley trying to withdraw himself unsuccessfully from the case in the courtroom. (Oakley is hilarious in almost every scene)

1556,betterCallSaul,"SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW AND BREAKING BAD
I was rewatching the show recently and I got to thinking, Lalo is probably the least evil Salamanca. I know the meme post about the town and all that, but I legitimately think some of these fools are on to something. Let's look at the Salamanca's we know.
1. Tuco. No explanation really needed. He is a sadistic monster that enjoys making people suffer, getting pleasure out of breaking those guys legs and beating up Jessie, kidnapping Walt and Jessie to take to Mexico etc. Pretty chaotic evil person.
2. Hector. Also a sadistic scumbag. He abused the twins when they were kids, had an awful temper and, as Lalo said, ""he just wants to kill everybody""
3. The twins count as one imo. They are in a Todd situation where they're emotionless killing machines with no regard for human life.
Now for Lalo. 
So for one he is the only Salamanca to show any concern for others when he appears to be upset when everyone at his compound was killed. Other Salamanca's would have treated their deaths inconvenience and only be angry that they were targeted. He also seems to have some level of camaraderie with his fellow gangsters. Some of his gangster buddies at his compound appeared to  legitimately like him and be happy to see him unlike every other Salamanca that relied entirely on their thugs being petrified of them to keep order. 
Lalo goes out of his way many times to avoid needless carnage and figures out every angle of situations before making his move. He put in unbelievable amounts of effort to work with Gus despite how suspicious Gus acts through the series. He even buried the hatchet to an extent after the fake chicken freezer meeting. We never see him take pleasure in hurting others. 
The smoking gun here is definitely when he killed Fred for no reason, he could have easily come up with another plan to get the camera footage. I'm close to saying that even though the scene is morbidly hilarious it is out of character for Lalo to hit the murder button that fast. He lets Jimmy go and pays him every dime for his bag man work. Toward the end when he goes all detective mode he was totally justified as everyone was bullshitting him and he had tried many times to give people the benefit of the doubt. By that point he was done with everyone's bullshit and was taking no quarter.  And he STILL didn't kill jimmy or Kim. You think Kim would have been able to talk down Hector, Tuco or the twins after the first bag man conversation? Hell no. Also he has a great taco tutorial on the YouTube.
 Essentially what I'm saying in this post is that I drank 3 cups of coffee yesterday and its 5am. Also Lalo, if you don't fuck with him and just do your job, he will probably treat you with respect. Why he wasn't sent to deal with Gus in the first place I have no idea, he is in New Mexico for like a week and totally unravels Gus' operation and only dies due to bad luck. He is obviously an evil person, but I think if he had an alignment dot, first of all I think he'd be neutral evil, but more importantly his ""dot"" would be toward the middle of NE while every other Salamanca would be at the absolute edge of chaotic evil. Twins Lawful evil also at the edge. Anyway this was mostly for fun, give me your thoughts y'all :)
Also apologies for wall of text, I don't know how to force paragraph breaks on Reddit.",Lalo is the least evil Salamanca.

I originally had all of season 2 in one post.  I'm going to try splitting it into two episodes per post.

During  the original broadcast, I  didn't discover the Insiders Podcast until  season 5.  I'm doing a  rewatch now, and listening to the Insiders  Podcast after every episode.

Here's my notes on season 1:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season\_1\_insiders\_podcast\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season_1_insiders_podcast_notes/)

&amp;#x200B;

 

From 2x07 Insiders Podcast:

\* The teaser in 2x07 was originally supposed to be shown in 1x09.¬† But they didn't have time.

This was the teaser where a con man tricked Jimmy's father, and told Jimmy that the world was full of ""wolves and sheep"".

Gilligan says there's two philosophies to editing.¬† One big cut, or 1,000 little cuts.¬† He went with the former.

They  told the actor that played the con man, over lunch, that they  didn't  have room for his scene.¬† But they might use it in the future.

He was understanding.

\*  Gilligan admitted that he later learned that Cicero, Illinois was on   the South Side of Chicago.¬† Therefore, Jimmy should be a White Sox fan.

However,  he then thought that maybe the store, where the Cubs logo is in  the  window, is on the North Side.¬† And maybe Jimmy's father commutes to  the  North Side to his store.

If not,  then Gilligan admits he might have screwed up the sports  affiliation,  and that the store + Jimmy should be White Sox fans.

\* Schweikart &amp; Cokely is supposed to be different than HHM in these ways:

¬† 1)¬† There's two female partners.  
¬†  2)¬† The round table, where the board room is, is a contrast to the   rectangular table in the HHM board room.¬† In the round table at   Schweikart &amp; Cokely, everyone can see each other.

The round table is also small, compared to HHM's huge table.

So these things are supposed to provide a different feel.

\*  The montage of Jimmy performing various actions to try and get fired   without cause, may have been their hardest montage yet.¬† Even harder   than the ""bar tricks"" montage from 1x10.

\* They had to get clearance for every item in Jimmy's father's shop.¬† Whether it was Nilla Wafers, the Cubs logo, etc.

\* In the writers' room, they think about the Mr. Miyagi quote from ""The Karate Kid"".

""Walk on left side of road, safe.

Walk on right side of road, safe.

Walk in middle . . . squish like grape.""

They think Kim's decision to start her own practice is symbolic of this quote.

They ponder whether she might be the truck driver, but then decide that no, they think she will be the grape.

\*  The real estate agent that shows Mike and Stacey the house, is the   same one from Breaking Bad, who confronted Marie about stealing.

\*  When Kim is thinking about Chuck's story about Jimmy's father, and how   Jimmy stole from the store, while Kim does think that there is truth to   what Chuck says, she doesn't believe it 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the 2x08 Insiders Podcast:

\*  The opening teaser was done in one shot.¬† Meaning, the camera rolled   continuously.¬† There is one small cut during the sequence.  
\* The opening teaser was supposed to be about another 1:30 - 2 minutes longer.¬† They cut off the end.

\*  The scene at the Dog House was supposed to be longer.¬† They pared it   down so you still got the gist of the scene, which was that Kim wasn't   going to do anything unethical to try and retain Mesa Verde, such as   telling them before she resigned from HHM.

\*  The actor who played Fudge, the fake war veteran, actually auditioned   to be on the bus with the other Sandpiper Crossing residents in 2x03.

His  audition was unusual, in that he had a pair of sunglasses, and  pulled  them off, like it was CSI Miami.¬† And he then put them back on.¬†  It was  funny.

But it didn't fit into the way the other residents on the bus were.¬† It was like he was auditioning for a whole different show.

They thought, they have to use him somewhere.¬† So when they wrote the part for the fake war veteran in 2x08, he came to mind.

\* When they initially wrote the scene for the B-29, they thought they were going to just use an image of one.

Then they thought, let's use a real one.¬† So they got the last real B-29, Fifi, to fly to Double Eagle Airport.

Fifi  actually travels to different airports.¬† Gilligan recommends that   people ride in it.¬† It's expensive, but worth it, he says.

\* Ariel Levine is writer and post PA.¬† On her own, she researched banking law stuff.¬† And she went to a legal law library.

No one told her to do that.¬† She just did it.

Vince  Gilligan then praised her, and said that she is making the most of  her  job.¬† He says, too often, there's people that take a job as an   assistant.

Then within 1 - 2 weeks, they're trying to slip the boss a script, or ask when they can direct.

He says they're not paying their dues.

In contrast, he says Ariel went above and beyond her job.¬† And she did that on her own time.¬†

So he praised her work ethic, and desire to pay her dues.

\* Jonathan Banks and writer Thomas Schnauz don't always get along.¬† Banks calls Schnauz the ""Little Prince"".¬†

Schnauz says maybe he'll give Banks even less dialogue, and have more scenes with him just sitting in a car, eating a sandwich.",Season 2 Insiders Podcast Notes: 2x07 - 2x08.

I originally had all of season 2 in one post.  I'm going to try splitting it into two episodes per post.

During  the original broadcast, I  didn't discover the Insiders Podcast until  season 5.  I'm doing a  rewatch now, and listening to the Insiders  Podcast after every episode.

Here's my notes on season 1:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season\_1\_insiders\_podcast\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season_1_insiders_podcast_notes/)

&amp;#x200B;

 

From the 2x03 Insiders Podcast:

\*  They spent the most amount of time designing Chuck's house.¬† They had   to really think about how it should look, and whether they were going   too far.¬† One idea was to have shorted wires coming out of walls.

\*  One idea for 2x01 was that after Jimmy turns down Davis &amp; Main, he   then scams someone to get a Cadillac.¬† They decided not to do that.

\* The place where Nacho meets Mike is a real location, by the rail yards.¬† That's where steam engines used to get repaired.

\* Gilligan is not a fan of telling people exactly how to interpret things.

With  that said, he did say that maybe Stacey is scamming Mike to get him  to  move into a better place.¬† OR, maybe she really thinks she hears gun   shots, and has PTSD.¬† Maybe she's using Mike because she knows Mike   wants to be part of a family.¬† But they also both want that.¬† It could   be interpreted any way.

\* The toy Mike gives Kaylee is the same one he would use in Breaking Bad, season 5.

\*  They point out how Jimmy does the wrong thing at every turn.¬† He   solicits clients.¬† He airs a commercial without Cliff Main's approval.¬†   He lies to Kim and says he got Cliff's approval.¬† And how this is bad,   because he's basically the newest guy in the firm, but his commercial   will represent Davis &amp; Main, without their permission.

He just has to do things his own way, every time.¬† He takes the shortest path.

\*  Vince Gilligan doesn't really understand the nuances of why it's ok to   have a billboard to attract clients, or air a TV commercial, but not   solicit clients like Jimmy did on the bus.¬† He says he doesn't   understand why it's unethical, and maybe some people in the legal field   can help out.

I have the same questions myself.

\* Davis &amp; Main should be a place that Jimmy likes.¬† It's more diverse and open.¬† But he keeps sabotaging it.

From the 2x04 Insiders Podcast:

Rhea Seehorn is a guest host.

\* Kelley Dixon left the podcast after a few minutes, because she was sick.

\* Seehorn asked if they wrote the part for Tuco, before knowing whether he would be available.

They said yes.

She then asked if there had ever been a situation, where a part was written for someone specific, and they weren't available.

Gilligan  then told the story of how Odenkirk wasn't available for the  Breaking  Bad season 2 finale. So auditioned for another character, ""the   cleaner"".

Gilligan was watching  auditions on the computer, and saw Jonathan Banks.  He loved him from  ""Wiseguy"". Wiseguy was appointment viewing for  Gilligan in the 1980s.

Thinking  about it now, Gilligan also says it would have been hard for  Saul  Goodman to clean up Jane's death. It's just so much more physical  and  hands on.

And he wouldn't have taken a hold of Jesse, like Mike did.

\* Seehorn appreciates how Kim is supporting, but not ancillary. She's her own person.

She  also says that in her mind, Kim and Jimmy have had sex before, or at   least talked about it. Because Kim is not alarmed when Jimmy calls late   at night; she knows he might want to ""talk dirty""; she knows about the   ""sex robot voice"".

She also says  it was important that Kim and Jimmy not be drunk in 2x01,  and that it  was a conscious decision to sleep together. She also said  the moments  leading up to the kiss, were more important than the kiss.

\* El Michoacano is a real restaurant.

The  idea came up from a Breaking Bad line, where Heisenberg and Jesse  meet  Tuco at a junk yard. Jesse asks why they aren't meeting at a Taco   Cabeza.

So they started to create a Taco Cabeza, then found El Michoacano, and it was a perfect location, with the decor.

The idea is that they do these deals in plain sight. And that the cartel probably terrorizes the restaurant owner.",Season 2 Insiders Podcast Notes: 2x03 - 2x04.

From the 2x01 Insiders Podcast:

\*  The actor that plays Pryce says it's fun to drive the Hummer. He says   it's fun to drive like you don't give a shit. (Also from an earlier   podcast, it's revealed he almost got the part for Mr. Kettleman. When he   didn't get it, they kept him in mind for a future part.)

\*  Odenkirk considered not watching himself, because he thought he then   might try to overcorrect some takes. But he decided he needed to watch   himself, to make sure he understood the tone correctly of what was being   portrayed.

\* They recalled a  role where Dustin Hoffman once stayed up for 3 days,  so he could play a  character that had been up for 3 days. Odenkirk says  he wouldn't do  that. He says a good actor should be able to play a  character, then  stop.

""Next time, try acting.""

\*  The rich guy by the pool, that Jimmy wants to run a scam on, is   wearing a James Bond Sean Connery era suit.¬† This is when Jimmy tries   calling Kim, but it goes to voice mail.¬† He then calls Davis &amp; Main   after that.

\*  Odenkirk hasn't turned off his phone at night, since his kid was born.   But his wife Naomi suggested turning it off, in an effort for her to   get some sleep for one night.

No one ever called at night, anyways.

So he turned it off.

When  he woke up, there were a ton of text messages from his 12 year old   son, saying ""help me help me, I'm screaming, where are you?""

He  was in a new room, and there had been a rain storm, and there had been   a bunch of weird banging and knocking noises that he had never heard   before.

Odenkirk felt like a horrible father.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the 2x02 Insiders Podcast:

\*  The upholstery shop is a real shop. On the day they were filming that   scene, there was a car jacking near by and a couple then barricaded   themselves in a nearby auto parts store. The cops then said that no one   could leave the set.

Usually  there is a mobile trailer with a bathroom. But because they  couldn't  leave the location, they had to use the bathroom inside the  upholstery  shop. The entire crew had to use it during those several  hours, so  there was a long line all day.

\* Odenkirk prefers driving the Suzuki Esteem to the Mercedes.",Season 2 Insiders Podcast Notes: 2x01 - 2x02.
1564,betterCallSaul,What I‚Äôd give to watch breaking bad and this for the first time ever again,Time to start my first (of many) rewatches of this show
1565,betterCallSaul,"I‚Äôve just watched the episode where &gt;!Nacho dies!&lt; and I honestly don‚Äôt remember/understand some of the things that led up to this. 

1. Why couldn‚Äôt Gus just let Nacho run off to Canada like he wanted? The Salamanca‚Äôs already knew he was the traitor. Sure they suspected Gus, but Mike planted evidence that it was a Colombian gang paying Nacho. Also, if the original plan was Gus sent Nacho to Mexico to die at the hands of the Salamanca‚Äôs, he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to fortify the story that it was Alvarez. 

2. Do you think Mike was planning to let Nacho actually run off and he was gonna shoot anyone who tried to stop him?

3. Why exactly do Jimmy and Kim hate Howard so much again‚Ä¶ I thought it was already shown he was only kinda douchey because of Chuck‚Äôs influence. 

4. When did Jimmy represent Tuco? That DA lady told Kim that Jimmy represented him before and I don‚Äôt remember this. Why would he do that? Was he paid to?",Some s6 questions (spoilers below)
1566,betterCallSaul,I know that when the season 6 episodes were aired live they had teasers for the next episode play at the end. Does anyone know where i can find them? like on youtube or something.,Where can i watch the teasers that aired live after the season 6 episodes?

1570,betterCallSaul,"There is a lot of debate over whether Chuck was right and made the ethical decision with keeping Jimmy out. And this moral ambiguity is part of what makes the show so great. But I think that the show makes it pretty clear that Chuck is absolutely wrong and that his decision was fueled more by resentment than ethics.

It feels like the only reason people think Chuck was right is because they go into BCS already knowing exactly what Jimmy would become. But there‚Äôs nothing that says Chuck was right *then*. That Jimmy couldn‚Äôt change, even when he was so motivated to reform himself and earn Chucks respect. Hell, even if he did end up going back to his old ways, he‚Äôd probably be quickly fired with bosses like Howard and Chuck. Chuck had nothing to lose by just giving Jimmy a *chance*...

And the only reason Chuck does this is from childhood resentment. The flashbacks clearly show that Chuck envies Jimmy. Chuck is socially awkward, especially compared to his charming younger brother. He feels like the law is the one thing he has. Jimmy becoming a lawyer is usurping that from him. That‚Äôs the reason, not ethics. Chuck is willing to bend the rules just as much to take Jimmy down. He is a hypocrite. In fact, he is a lot like Walter White. Not as bad, but he shares a lot of toxic qualities. So no, Chuck absolutely wasn‚Äôt right...",Chuck was NOT right.

In S01 (i believe E06?) Saul spills the coffee on the cop and Mike mugs his notebook. Later in the episode theres a scene where Mike breaks into a cop car with a rope. Its just shortly before the flashback. I assumed he broke into the cop car to put back the notebook so he can make it look like the cop from the interrogation room accidentally dropped it in his car. But seems like that was not the case as they later admit to ""having found it"" in the parking lot. 

Can someone explain? What was that scene about where he entered the cop car? And was that already part of the flashback?",Question about the notebook and Mike in S01

1599,betterCallSaul,"I think they could do something more with this show. It‚Äôs in a very bad state at the moment, and is frowned upon by every fan of the franchise. Here‚Äôs how I think the people working on it could fix the show fluidly, without any retconning. 

Season one: six very childish episodes about Jimmy in his childhood years getting into whatever the fuck this show is. 

Concept season 2: fast forward to Jimmy‚Äôs teenage years. He and Marco have grown and matured a bit. They‚Äôre looking to score weed or something for a few episodes. The animation style changes, and the show takes on a slightly more serious tone, reflecting the characters as they age. Similar to Breaking Bad, we get to see James McGill slowly transition to Slippin‚Äô Jimmy. To score weed, or girls or something, Jimmy begins to manipulate people, and starts to act ever-so-slightly sinister. He even steals beer from his dad‚Äôs convenience store. 

Concept season 3: Jimmy is 23. He and Marco have began visiting the bar. The animation style changes, now a few steps closer to looking real. The tone still reflects the characters, and the show takes on a very mature style, almost entirely ditching humor. In this season, Jimmy isn‚Äôt slippin‚Äô people, but instead getting slipped himself. Throughout the season, Jimmy is subject to being the butt of every joke, and watches as the winner takes it all. This is a season of embarrassment, a season of loss, a season of learning through pain. Jimmy slowly starts wising up to the rigged bets and arrogant people taking advantage of him, and the season ends with him outsmarting a rigged bet, and taking it all as the winner. 

Concept season 4: Jimmy is roughly 30. Yet again the animation changes, with lots of realism. The tone of the show shifts to be similar to Breaking Bad S4. Jimmy and Marco are taking advantage of people at the bar, and not giving a damn about it. The show has sort of a double-tone, with Jimmy and Marco thriving by metaphorically stepping on others, a morally wrong thing. In this season, we see several cons run by Jimmy and Marco, one per episode. 

The season, and show, ends with ‚ÄúThe Slip‚Äù. The episode is spent setting up the incident, and the episode ends abruptly as Jimmy is mid-slip, cutting the scene off before he hits the ground. 

This show can be saved with heavy revision and a budget overhaul. I believe that it could potentially be a fine addition to the Breaking Bad franchise, but only if done absolutely right.",Slippin‚Äô Jimmy can be saved

1605,betterCallSaul,"I want to start this with some clarification, I love Mike's character and I understand that he is written to be complex, like many of the characters.

However, I feel like the fanbase seems to view him too favourably. I don't just mean because he's a badass and interesting, but people seem to act like he's a more moral person than he is.

Starting at his backstory, he was a bent cop, we don't know all the details, but as far back as we know he wasn't a moral person. His activities caused the death of his son. He responded (arguably understandably) by murdering the two that killed his son. He already has three deaths on his hands by the BCS timeline.

He wanted to provide for his son's wife and child, that is admirable, but he chose crime. His activities put them at risk as we saw when the twins threatened him and his granddaughter. 

He killed Werner, and yes he was torn about it, but he did it. A good man, with a wife at home, he murdered him. That was the moment he fully got into the game and you may say he had no choice. But he did, his emotions didn't mean anything just like Walt and Saul's emotions don't take away from the bad they've done. 

Throughout both series he killed countless people, yes they were almost all 'in the game' but so was he, many were just doing their job like he was and would have families too. 

He had already earned good money throughout BCS and could have provided plenty for his family, why did he stay in the game? It was only a risk to himself and to his family. 

He was willing to kill Walt at the end of S3, because Walt had killed two drug dealers who had murdered a child. Walt wasn't a good person and stepped out of line so to speak. But really? Why was Mike tolerating the murder of children? Why didn't he get out of the game with Gus.

I feel like Vince had a deeper message behind Howard‚Äôs spiral, the betrayal and his overall life. Howard.. is an honest man through and through.

1629,betterCallSaul,"I just finished Season 4, currently in the middle of the first episode of Season 5 and I feel like I need to take a break to gather my thoughts.

My emotions towards Jimmy are so conflicted, at one moment I feel bad for him and in the next I'm left wondering, does he even deserve any sympathy?

His talk with Kristy Esposito was really eye opening, that guy clearly sees himself as a victim and he resents everyone else because of how they treat him as someone beneath them. There's clearly alot of bent up anger because of how Chuck refused to change his perception of him as Slippin' Jimmy and insisted that he will never change, and because of all that resentment he has no issues or regrets becoming someone immoral, he's even okay with encouraging a minor to behave like him, and from the way he was talking, he probably even sees it as some sort of heroic act as if he's saving her.

I think the question here is, does Jimmy refuse to change because of how Chuck (and the others) treated him, as in due to resentment or out of spite or something similar, or is it *because* of how Chuck treated him.

I don't know what I'm supposed to feel towards him at this point. It's true that he is ""always down"" like Kim has put it, but it seems like he's the one always putting himself down. He keeps wasting good opportunities left and right and doesn't treat the one person who deeply cares for him fairly, despite her standing by him no matter what happens.
I guess the only thing that does make me feel sorry for him is how he constantly sees himself as not good enough for Kim, and how their relationship only gets all romance-y and exciting when they're scamming together and on the same page. However, Kim isn't consistent about who she's trying to be so he's always in that hard place where he feels distant and probably doubts that she loves him for who he is, and his only way of 'fixing' it is trying to drag her down with him and then feel bad afterwards, possibly because he then realizes she's either not fully committed or she has that moral high ground that Chuck always had over him.  At least that's how I see it.

Thoughts?",Am I even supposed to feel bad for him?

1651,betterCallSaul,"After the finale of the hit AMC series *Breaking Bad*, Vince Gilligan is creating the prequel *Better Call Saul* starring Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman, Walter's white sleazy lawyer. While initially conceived as a 30-minute comedy drama, AMC has ultimately decided that the series would be a 1-hour drama‚Äîjust like *Breaking Bad*‚Äîshowing the lawyer's descent into immorality. Moreover, leaks indicate that the series will feature an additional protagonist's descent into immorality: Michael Ehrmantraut, Saul Goodman's private investigator and Gustavo Fring's hitman.

Many *Breaking Bad* actors will not reprise their roles for *Better Call Saul* Season 1. Unsurprisingly, Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, and RJ Mitte will not be reprising their roles as Walter White, Skyler White, Marie Schrader, and Flynn White respectively; for the White family does not become a criminal powerhouse until Walter White's cancer diagnosis. Moreover, Aaron Paul and Dean Norris will reprise their roles as methamphetamine addict Jesse Pinkman and DEA agent Henry Schrader, indicating that Season 1 of *Better Call Saul* will not heavily feature drug-related crime. Additionally, the absence of Giancarlo Esposito and Laura Fraser as Gustavo Fring and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle further confirm this, and they indicate that Michael Ehrmantraut will not meet Gustavo Fring this season. The absence of Jesse Plemons as Todd Alquist also pinpoints the season occurring before Saul Goodman meets Ira, the owner of Vamonos Pest.

However, Vince Gilligan is introducing new characters this season, among which are Kimberly Wexler (played by Rhea Seehorn), an HHM attorney and love interest of Saul Goodman, Howard Hamlin (played by Patrick Fabian), the boss of HHM whom Saul Goodman and Kimberly Wexler despise, Ignacio Varga (played by Michael Mando), a low-level street criminal akin to Jesse Pinkman, and Charles McGill (played by Michael McKean), the former boss of HHM and Saul Goodman's brother. Interestingly, Charles McGill's surname is the same surname Saul Goodman mentions he has in Season 2 Episode 8 of *Breaking Bad*, mentioning how ""the real name \[is\] McGill"", indicating that Saul Goodman's real name is Saul McGill.

The leaked cast is:

1. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman
2. Jonathan Banks as Michael Ehrmantraut
3. Rhea Seehorn as Kimberly Wexler
4. Patrick Fabian as Howard Hamlin
5. Michael Mando as Ignacio Varga
6. Michael McKean as Charles McGill

1657,betterCallSaul,"Not saying the show isn't good, it's an amazing show and I wouldn't argue with anyone saying it's better than BB. But I don't think they fully captured the same BB Saul Goodman when he's supposed to be that character in that timeline, he seemed a lot more relaxed and smooth in that show than in BCS. And I also think they got carried away with Jimmy's character at times, I know he was extremely sleazy in BB as he was basically a smooth talking devils advocate, but I didn't picture him to be directly manipulative for the purpose of hurting people, for example of Irene and the old folks at the end of season 3, or Gene in S6. I think they took it too far in this case, not because it's hard to watch but I didn't think Saul was that low

They made him out to be such an asshole tbh and I truly believe he would come off as way more reasonable if he wasn't so. For example he is 100% within reason to not like Howard Hamlin and think he should go fuck himself at the business lunch in S5 but he completely shatters being in the right afterwards",Did Saul Goodman in BCS feel like a parody of BB Saul at times for you guys?

None of this takes on 4 fully grown men in a fist fight BS that you always see in Hollywood. Completely grounded in reality but at the same time exudes extreme confidence and toughness. Kinda rambling here but it was such a breath of fresh air to see a female character be the epitome of a girl boss.

1673,betterCallSaul,"I've always thought it would be interesting for someone who had never seen either show to experience all the scenes in chronological order, the way [this list details](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/wpry5o/full_chronology_of_every_bcsbrba_scene/). It seems like it would drastically change how you percieve most of the story. It would obviously not make as much dramatic or narrative sense, but I think it would be really interesting to see what someone's impression would be if this was their only exposure to the BB universe:

Essentially we would have a story where we meet Jimmy as a child, see how his father's actions caused him to pursue a life of conning people. We watch his antics with his good friend Marco, before he gives up his life of crime to move to Albuquerque. Throughout all of this, we would see strange scenes from characters we don't know anything about: an older man playing with his child, a chemist buying a house with his wife, a drug dealer who had his partner murdered in a pool, and a young girl who's mother encourages her to steal. This would be really confusing to first time viewers, especially since some of these characters wouldn't be mentioned again until way later in the story. 

Flash forward in the story. Jimmy and Chuck watch their mother pass away. Jimmy gets his law degree and tries to impress chuck, despite being less than successful. The two of them have a strange conversation about regrets and a time machine, something that doesn't get brought up again until the very end of the show. Through all of this, we see that Jimmy's brother has developed a strange illness.

We then transition to a new character, the old man who was playing with his child, now an even older man named Mike. He murders two police officers in order to avenge his son, then moves to Albuquerque to take care of his daughter in law and granddaughter. 

Then we would transition back to Jimmy, sticking with him for a good portion of the story. We would basically experience season 1 as it normally was, but we would have no idea what Jimmy's fate would be in the future. For a first time viewer, we would be very hopeful for Jimmy's pursuit into elder law. We would continue following the normal progression of Jimmy's for several seasons, as well as a few tangents following Nacho and Mike's life. We also reintroduce the drug dealer from the beginning, and learn that he is the owner of Los Pollos Hermanos. We would slowly watch Jimmy transform himself into a character named Saul Goodman, and wonder what he will do next.

At this point we would basically watch the rest of Better Call Saul in order, minus any flash forwards. We would still have a hopeful look for Jimmy and Kim's future.

However, once we reach reach Jimmy and Kim's divorce, the show changes completely. Jimmy has completely converted to being Saul Goodman and no longer cares for Kim. After they sign their divorce papers, Kim meets a young kid named Jesse Pinkman. At this point the show transitions to a completely new character, some random nerd named Walter White. 

We learn that the man has cancer and we watch as he teams up with Kim's friend Jesse in order to cook and sell crystal meth. At this point the viewer would be really confused. Who are these new characters? Why do they look younger? What does this have to do with Jimmy and Kim's story? The only characters we would recognize at this point are Jesse, Hank, and Krazy-8, who would immediately die.

That is until Saul reappears, now operating as Walt and Jesse's lawyer. We would think it's weird that he never brings up Kim, but we would be happy to see both Huell and Francesca. We watch Walt and Jesse kidnap Saul, who begs for his life, worried that Lalo has come for him. However, once he learns Lalo isn't involved, he takes control of the situation and becomes their full time lawyer. After Mike investigates Walt, Saul decides he's going to help him become a master criminal. Saul effectively jumpstarts Walter White's entire operation.

After this point we would follow Walt through the rest of his life, with a few instances of Saul reappearing in the story. At this point we would basically watch Walt **kill every character we've grown to love from Better Call Saul** and any first time viewers would just hate this guy at this point. They would be almost glad to see him die at the end, and then they would watch Jesse make his escape.

After all of that, we would finally return to Jimmy, now known as Gene, living a sad life in Omaha. He would do his best to stay hidden, but when Jeff recognizes him, he hatches a plan to keep his identity safe. While his plan works, a phone call from Kim spirals him into a return to his crime life. This eventually gets Jimmy arrested and tried for his crimes of assisting Walter White. However, Jimmy does the right thing and confesses to his crimes, saving Kim from any lawsuit. The show ends just as it begun, with the two of them smoking. The last shot we see is Jimmy watching from prison.

This would actually be a pretty satisfying ending, but it seems like this format would make the viewers absolutely hate Walt even more.",Watching BB/BCS in chronological order as a first time viewer

1684,betterCallSaul,"I'm a little confused by this, and I haven't found any solid answer. 

Im referring to [this scene](https://youtu.be/Wnp4OeVSgkE), in case you've forgot. Mike had ""a guy"", and it's not Jesse. After the backstory we got on Better Call Sauk, the question remains, who was it?

I've only got 4 possible explanations, without any of them being entirely convincing.

1) Victor. Victor, if I'm not mistaken, died earlier in the show. That's why Mike's got no guy anymore. This seems to be the most common answer to this question on the internet. And, before BCS, it made sense, but in BCS we learn that both Victor and Tyrus are Gus' guys, and they were there before Mike came along. They're even sometimes opposed to Mike, as we see in BCS a handful of time.

2) Matt. This one makes less sense because, if I'm not mistaken, Mike and his son didn't work together that much, or at least we're not told they did. But this option captures Mike's sense of loss in that scene: he had a guy, he doesn't anymore; he had a son, he doesn't anymore. 

3) Nacho. Mike's sympathizes with him and decides to protect his father. Nacho wasn't explicitly ""his guy"", Gus was blackmailing him while Nacho wanted out, but he still worked under Mike, and he worked well. I think this is probably the answer Gilligan and Gould would've give, but I'm not 100% convinced because, as I said, Nacho wasn't working for him out of his own will, he was being blackmailed. Also, he wasn't around that long, and in the end he didn't accomplish that much, Lalo survived. Mike's empathic towards him, but does that empathy go as far as to say Nacho was ""the guy""?

4) Some unspecified character. BrBa and BCS do this: Saul's previous two wifes, what happened in Santiago, Gus' backstory, why Walter left Grey Matter, etc. We are not given all the details, there are characters who we don't know about and never will. Mike's guy could be in this category: he had a guy in the police, like Steve Gomez is to Hank, they had a story, and either he died or he's not longer Mike's guy because well, Mike left the police and Pennsylvania. Probably the first one, because, if he was alive, I think he'd have a role in Mike's backstory, when he struggled with Matty's death, becoming somewhat alcoholic and killing those two corrupt cops.

Mike had other guys (11, if I'm not mistaken), the ones who were killed in prison, but they all died after that scene and I don't think any of those deserve being called ""**the** guy"" by Mike.

So yeah, idk. What do y'all think?",Who was Mike's guy after all?

What do you guys think?","Why was Gus given so much trust being an outsider, wouldn't the show's cartel have seen him more as a threat than an ally if he was able to move so much product and had that much distribution networks that he was capable of possibly competing with them/going rogue?"
1735,betterCallSaul,[removed],Question about Saul/Jimmy's 'chicanery'
1736,betterCallSaul,"One of my favorite pastimes has become analyzing this show and recently I‚Äôve been thinking about how the writers decided to structure the life of Jimmy/Saul/Gene as a man who goes through repetitive cycles in his life that lead him down his specific path. Messing with Chuck‚Äôs documents leading to his suicide, pranking Howard leading to his murder, working with Walter White leading to Heisenberg‚Äôs empire, and manipulating Jeff leading to his ultimate downfall, Jimmy McGill is repeatedly shown to be a creature of patterns. This led me to look for patterns within the different seasons of the show, and I think I found a big one that repeats every season: Jimmy‚Äôs willingness to pull out of a con once the stakes get too high. 

Season 1 - Scamming with Marco: Marco feigns a medical emergency, Jimmy and the unsuspecting mark find the fake watch and the wallet and Jimmy pockets some extra cash. Once Jimmy realizes that Marco is actually having a heart attack, he gives up the con without second thought and tries to help his friend. The mark instantly knows something is up and flees, but Jimmy doesn‚Äôt care. 

Season 2 - Covering His Mesa Verde Tracks: Jimmy pays off the copy boy to lie about seeing him forge the documents and sticks around to watch the interaction with Chuck play out. Jimmy sees Chuck collapse and injure himself and Jimmy hesitates, hoping someone else will step in and help, but when I one does, Jimmy gives up the con and rushes to his brother‚Äôs aid. Chuck knows this confirms Jimmy‚Äôs guilt but Jimmy doesn‚Äôt care and manages to get lucky and avoid the fallout thanks to Ernie‚Äôs lie. 

Season 3 - Mrs. Landry: Jimmy tricks the class representative into settling the case early by isolating her entirely from her elderly community of friends. The social damage seems to be more severe than anticipated and Jimmy begrudgingly launches a counter-scheme to implicate himself and undo everything, completely destroying his career in elder law in the process. 

Season 4 - Getting the License Back: Jimmy needs to appear sincere about Chuck‚Äôs death in order to get his law license reinstated. He pays for a library, cries elephant tears at the grave, sits on a committee, and launches into an emotional speech at the bar hearing. At the last second, Jimmy reveals it was all a con in his mind, intended to elicit emotional reactions from the board members to get him what he wants. For the first time, Jimmy has stopped stopping. 

Season 5 - The Sham Marriage: Jimmy realizes his relationship with Kim has put her in direct contact with Lalo Salamanca. The entire marriage is a con in and of itself, not born out of love entirely, but out of legal necessity to avoid compelled testimony against one another. Jimmy is prepared to end the relationship, realizing he is bad for Kim, and wants to distance himself in order to keep her safe and remove her from the crosshairs of Lalo. However, Jimmy fails to pull the plug and instead gets sucked into another scheme. Once again, Jimmy doesn‚Äôt stop. 

Season 6A - Howard‚Äôs Character Assassination: Jimmy and Kim destroy Howard‚Äôs character to force early settlement, and even when given plenty of opportunities to pull the plug, they go through with it and Howard is shockingly killed. Once again, a con wasn‚Äôt stopped. 

Season 6B - Life Alert and Hard Won Truth: Jimmy has a helpless elderly woman cornered in her home, threatening her with a phone cord and a pretty uncharacteristic flare up of violence. All that stands in the way of his freedom is this one old lady, but finally, for the first time in three seasons, Jimmy starts stopping again. He realizes he is too far gone and things have gone on long enough. He sees his friend dead on the sidewalk. He sees his brother bleeding in a copy shop. He sees an old lady shunned from her friends. He remembers the con of his law license, the sham of a marriage, and the dead man on his apartment floor. And finally, he pulls out of the con. And even when he goes to jail and has the opportunity to con his way into a short sentence, he pumps the breaks again and ends the con before it can go too far. He brings himself back to reality. He grounds himself. He gets back whatever remains of his soul before careening off a cliff. 

Perhaps these are not perfect comparisons across the seasons, but when tracking the soul of Jimmy McGill, I always equate to whether or not the man was at a point in his life when he was willing to stop once things went too far. In seasons 1-3, he was able to do so. In seasons 4-6, he was not. His actions in the final episodes, where he proves he is once again able to start stopping again is what showed me the true redemption of a character who wasn‚Äôt too far gone.","Jimmy Stops Stopping, Until He Doesn‚Äôt"

1749,betterCallSaul,What happened?,what if chuck still alive
1750,betterCallSaul,"... and it's never felt resolved. 

Just something I find curious. In Season 6 we have Tyrus pulling a gun on Mike and zero-hesitation ready to drop him. Gus seems to have no qualms with it either until Mike can give them something. Gus repeatedly countermands Mike's advice, and the two seem little more than resenting each other every step of the way - if not outright coming to verbal blows many times. 

This feels so far removed from in BB when Mike &amp; Gus are thick as thieves. Gus trusts Mike implicitly every step, truly honors his advice, even uses him as the guy for the Mexico trip. Mike meanwhile earnestly believes in what Gus is doing, respects him, and even from &gt;!after his death!&lt; goes back to avenge him. 

That disconnect just seems so strong between BCS and BrBa's, and I'm curious how they grow to that point.",Mike &amp; Gus seem to resent each other far too much compared to BB.

Again, probably not considering how perfect both series are, but I would find that fascinating. And maybe also have Kim maybe fall into the BB timeline or something and have interactions with those characters.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my notes on season 1:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season\_1\_insiders\_podcast\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/yh3mm9/season_1_insiders_podcast_notes/)

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 2x01 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* The actor that plays Pryce says it's fun to drive the Hummer. He says  it's fun to drive like you don't give a shit. (Also from an earlier  podcast, it's revealed he almost got the part for Mr. Kettleman. When he  didn't get it, they kept him in mind for a future part.)  
 

\* Odenkirk considered not watching himself, because he thought he then  might try to overcorrect some takes. But he decided he needed to watch  himself, to make sure he understood the tone correctly of what was being  portrayed.  
 

\* They recalled a role where Dustin Hoffman once stayed up for 3 days,  so he could play a character that had been up for 3 days. Odenkirk says  he wouldn't do that. He says a good actor should be able to play a  character, then stop.  
 

""Next time, try acting.""  
 

\* The rich guy by the pool, that Jimmy wants to run a scam on, is  wearing a James Bond Sean Connery era suit.¬† This is when Jimmy tries  calling Kim, but it goes to voice mail.¬† He then calls Davis &amp; Main  after that.

&amp;#x200B;

 \* Odenkirk hasn't turned off his phone at night, since his kid was born.  But his wife Naomi suggested turning it off, in an effort for her to  get some sleep for one night.  
 

No one ever called at night, anyways.  
 

So he turned it off.  
 

When he woke up, there were a ton of text messages from his 12 year old  son, saying ""help me help me, I'm screaming, where are you?""  
 

He was in a new room, and there had been a rain storm, and there had been  a bunch of weird banging and knocking noises that he had never heard  before.  
 

Odenkirk felt like a horrible father.   
 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the 2x02 Insiders Podcast:  
 

&amp;#x200B;

\* The upholstery shop is a real shop. On the day they were filming that  scene, there was a car jacking near by and a couple then barricaded  themselves in a nearby auto parts store. The cops then said that no one  could leave the set.  
 

Usually there is a mobile trailer with a bathroom. But because they  couldn't leave the location, they had to use the bathroom inside the  upholstery shop. The entire crew had to use it during those several  hours, so there was a long line all day.  
 

\* Odenkirk prefers driving the Suzuki Esteem to the Mercedes.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

From the 2x03 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* They spent the most amount of time designing Chuck's house.¬† They had  to really think about how it should look, and whether they were going  too far.¬† One idea was to have shorted wires coming out of walls.  
 

\* One idea for 2x01 was that after Jimmy turns down Davis &amp; Main, he  then scams someone to get a Cadillac.¬† They decided not to do that.  
 

\* The place where Nacho meets Mike is a real location, by the rail yards.¬† That's where steam engines used to get repaired.  
 

\* Gilligan is not a fan of telling people exactly how to interpret things.  
 

With that said, he did say that maybe Stacey is scamming Mike to get him  to move into a better place.¬† OR, maybe she really thinks she hears gun  shots, and has PTSD.¬† Maybe she's using Mike because she knows Mike  wants to be part of a family.¬† But they also both want that.¬† It could  be interpreted any way.  
 

\* The toy Mike gives Kaylee is the same one he would use in Breaking Bad, season 5.  
 

\* They point out how Jimmy does the wrong thing at every turn.¬† He  solicits clients.¬† He airs a commercial without Cliff Main's approval.¬†  He lies to Kim and says he got Cliff's approval.¬† And how this is bad,  because he's basically the newest guy in the firm, but his commercial  will represent Davis &amp; Main, without their permission.  
 

He just has to do things his own way, every time.¬† He takes the shortest path.  
 

\* Vince Gilligan doesn't really understand the nuances of why it's ok to  have a billboard to attract clients, or air a TV commercial, but not  solicit clients like Jimmy did on the bus.¬† He says he doesn't  understand why it's unethical, and maybe some people in the legal field  can help out.  
 

I have the same questions myself.  
 

\* Davis &amp; Main should be a place that Jimmy likes.¬† It's more diverse and open.¬† But he keeps sabotaging it. 	 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

From the 2x04 Insiders Podcast:  
 

Rhea Seehorn is a guest host.  
 

\* Kelley Dixon left the podcast after a few minutes, because she was sick.  
 

\* Seehorn asked if they wrote the part for Tuco, before knowing whether he would be available.  
 

They said yes.  
 

She then asked if there had ever been a situation, where a part was written for someone specific, and they weren't available.  
 

Gilligan then told the story of how Odenkirk wasn't available for the  Breaking Bad season 2 finale. So auditioned for another character, ""the  cleaner"".  
 

Gilligan was watching auditions on the computer, and saw Jonathan Banks.  He loved him from ""Wiseguy"". Wiseguy was appointment viewing for  Gilligan in the 1980s.  
 

Thinking about it now, Gilligan also says it would have been hard for  Saul Goodman to clean up Jane's death. It's just so much more physical  and hands on.  
 

And he wouldn't have taken a hold of Jesse, like Mike did.  
 

\* Seehorn appreciates how Kim is supporting, but not ancillary. She's her own person.  
 

She also says that in her mind, Kim and Jimmy have had sex before, or at  least talked about it. Because Kim is not alarmed when Jimmy calls late  at night; she knows he might want to ""talk dirty""; she knows about the  ""sex robot voice"".  
 

She also says it was important that Kim and Jimmy not be drunk in 2x01,  and that it was a conscious decision to sleep together. She also said  the moments leading up to the kiss, were more important than the kiss.  
 

\* El Michoacano is a real restaurant.  
 

The idea came up from a Breaking Bad line, where Heisenberg and Jesse  meet Tuco at a junk yard. Jesse asks why they aren't meeting at a Taco  Cabeza.  
 

So they started to create a Taco Cabeza, then found El Michoacano, and it was a perfect location, with the decor.  
 

The idea is that they do these deals in plain sight. And that the cartel probably terrorizes the restaurant owner. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From 2x05:  
 

&amp;#x200B;

Rhea Seehorn, and writer Ann Cherkis are guest hosts.  
 

\* Gilligan talks about how a lot of auditions aren't live anymore.¬† He  likes being able to see them in person, as well as having them interact  with some of the other actors in scenes.¬†  
 

On the other hand, he also says it saves a lot of time by being able to  watch auditions on a screen.¬† He can watch so many more auditions now.¬†  Sometimes they've hired people directly off seeing their tape.  
 

Sometimes, people couldn't travel and make auditions, due to scheduling conflicts.  
 

\* Gilligan says he likes bullshitting with actors for several minutes,  to put them at ease.¬† It's also what he would have wanted.  
 

However, now he's thinking that for certain actors, it messes up their rhythm.¬† Some of them are ready to go, right away.  
 

\* Cherkis was close to working on Breaking Bad, 8 years ago.¬† She was  coming back from the dentist, and she got a call that Gilligan and Gould  want to meet her in one hour.  
 

She ended up not getting the job.  
 

They also think the decision probably came down to hiring Cherkis or  Gould.¬† (Not sure if that makes sense, but that's kind of what they  said.)  
 

\* Rhea Seehorn loves the set of the doc review room.¬† It feels like a real dungeon.  
 

Cherkis says she's been around law firms, and that's realistic of what they look like.  
 

\* Seehorn says that Kim probably started in the mail room, later in her career, like Jimmy.  
 

And she sees both herself and Jimmy as survivors.  
 

Part of the reason why Kim didn't break up with Jimmy right away, is  because she wanted Jimmy to sit in the moment of what he did.  
 

And, there's a part of her that understands his intentions.  
 

\* Seehorn says that part of the success of the show is hiring so many  actors with a background in theater.¬† Seehorn has worked in theater  where the audiences is on all four sides around her.¬† So she had to  learn to convey emotions with her whole body, all around her.  
 

Gilligan says some of the worst television is when they focus on so many  closeups with the face, and they don't focus on other parts of the  body.¬† They like doing some wider shots, to get the full read on the  person.  
 

\* Seehorn says Jimmy has probably told her about his father before.¬†  Because Kim told Jimmy about her father (how they watched movies), and  Kim isn't the type of person to share stuff first.¬† So Jimmy must have  shared something about his father first, before she shared her stuff  about her father.  
 

\* Seehorn says Kim has begun to lose moral and ethical respect for  Chuck.¬† Between what happened in 1x09, and this episode, where she asks  him about her job, and he uses that as an opportunity to tell a shit  story about Jimmy, she sees he has an agenda.¬† Also, she sees how he  uses his position of power during this scene.¬† He asks her, a lawer, to  make coffee.¬† He forces her to make two cups and meet with her.  
 

\* ""You're never not talking.¬† You're deciding why not to speak.""  
 

That describes Kim in her meeting with Chuck.¬† Kim's decision not to say anything has power.  
 

\* ""Wide shots are about loneliness or power.""  
 

That describes the scene when Howard tells Kim she's still in doc  review, despite the successful outcome of the Mesa Verde meeting, and he  leaves her standing outside.  
 

\* Michael McKean told Seehorn that he thought he would get something  entirely different out of Chuck's scene with Kim, when he was rehearsing  and practicing at home.  
 

\* Gilligan and Seehorn talk about how in theater, there is no such thing  as a ""monologue"", as the actor is playing off the audience's shift in  energy.  
 

Seehorn says that Jonathan Banks uses the same principle, and uses the camera as his scene partner.  
 

\* Seehorn talks about how during the meeting, Kim is watching Chuck to  see if it's ok to put things down without a coaster.¬† Because those  tables are nice.  
 

Gilligan didn't notice that, and now wants to rewatch that moment, to  see Kim looking around, to see if it's ok to put her coffee down without  a coaster.  
 

\* They hadn't really thought about the actor that plays Bill Oakley, Peter Diseth, back.¬† They love him, though.  
 

He's a local actor to Albuquerque.¬†  
 

They then thought it would be funny to shoot a scene where Oakley talks about how great Jimmy's life looks to him.  
 

But we know Jimmy doesn't like it at Davis &amp; Main.  
 

\* They also talked about Peter Diseth gave different takes on his lines each time, and they were all funny.  
 

For example, his lines of ""Omar?"" were a different weird but funny take each time.¬† Same with ""oh yeah, that's vomit.""  
 

\* They also talked about ""Pocket Dialogue"".¬†  
 

An example of pocket dialogue are Kim's exchanges when she's cold calling potential clients.  
 

Another example is from 1x02 during the courthouse montage, especially  when Odenkirk says ""there's a troll under the bridge"", in reference to  Mike. 	 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 2x06 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* During the scene when Jonathan Banks surprised Arturo, who had been  hiding inside his house, and disarmed him and took him down, Banks  suffered a swollen knee.  
 

He already had bad knees from before.  
 

When the stunt actor was falling down, he knocked Banks legs out from under him, and Banks fell.  
 

Banks then had a limp for the rest of the day.  
 

They actually filmed the scene where Banks walks up to the house, after  the take down scene, even though the take down scene occurs before.  
 

Banks had to hide his limp.  
 

\* During the scene where Mike is watching Kaylee in the pool, and he  sees the Cousins, who make threatening gun motions at Kaylee, they  filmed it in August. It is hot.  
 

During the last day of shooting, months later, Gilligan doesn't like Mike's reaction to seeing the threatening gun motions.  
 

""I need to see more jeopardy. I need to see more at stake.""  
 

Jonathan Banks had a flight the next morning.  
 

Still, they went and re-shot his reaction. It was now 35 degrees outside.  
 

Gilligan: I just wanted to see your nipples through your shirt.  
 

Jonathan Banks: They were hard, baby.  
 

His improved reaction was the ""one extra shake of salt on the fries."" They needed to see Mike go up to an 11/10.  
 

\* During the scene when Mike meets Hector at the ice cream shop, the  actor that plays Arturo, Vincent Fuentes, was giving Mike the middle  finger, off-camera.  
 

Mike told him, if you're going to do it, do it when you're in character.  
 

\*In this episode: Superman wears Mike Ehrmantraut pajamas.  
 

\* On Mike using a door mat with carbon paper to check for intruders:  They wanted to show a lo tech way that Mike could get the job done. Mike  will take the simplest way to get the job done.  
 

\* On what the meaning was of Jimmy removing the cup holder, so it could finally fit the World's 2nd Greatest Lawyer Mug:  
 

Right now, Jimmy can't help Kim. She told him she wanted to deal with her work herself.  
 

He's trying to live the straight life, but he's chafing.  
 

""It's the canary in the coal mine.""  
 

This thing about the cup holder not fitting, seems like a small thing.  But it grows bigger and bigger until it becomes untenable.  
 

This is the one thing he can control in his life right now.  
 

\* They digitally erased the brake lights when Jimmy drives away, after  removing the cup holder. If the brake lights had been visible, it would  have shown he was slowing down.  
 

By not having the brake lights, it makes it look like he's speeding up.  Giving a different subtle meaning now, with the removal of the brake  light.  
 

\* On why Kim initiates a scam in the middle of a work day, at the restaurant:  
 

Kim should be happy, but she's not.  
 

She hasn't felt happy in a long time. The last time she felt good was when she ran that scam with Jimmy in 2x01.  
 

When you don't feel good, some people go shopping. Some people go drinking.  
 

For Kim, it's doing the last thing that made her feel good, which was running a scam.  
 

\* Jimmy tells Kim to buck up, that they've both got everything they  could want. But we can see that neither is really happy, due to external  circumstances.  
 

Jimmy is too constricted by having Erin watch him so closely.  
 

Kim knows Howard still hates her at HHM.  
 

\* Kim does miss Jimmy. She waits for his phone call every morning, even  if she lets it go to voice mail, to listen to him singing to her.  
 

\* The mark in this episode wasn't supposed to be overly douchy. He did  kiss his girl outside the restaurant, before going inside and buying Kim  a drink. But it wasn't overt like with Ken Wins.

 From 2x07 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* The teaser in 2x07 was originally supposed to be shown in 1x09.¬† But they didn't have time.  
 

This was the teaser where a con man tricked Jimmy's father, and told Jimmy that the world was full of ""wolves and sheep"".  
 

Gilligan says there's two philosophies to editing.¬† One big cut, or 1,000 little cuts.¬† He went with the former.  
 

They told the actor that played the con man, over lunch, that they  didn't have room for his scene.¬† But they might use it in the future.  
 

He was understanding.  
 

\* Gilligan admitted that he later learned that Cicero, Illinois was on  the South Side of Chicago.¬† Therefore, Jimmy should be a White Sox fan.  
 

However, he then thought that maybe the store, where the Cubs logo is in  the window, is on the North Side.¬† And maybe Jimmy's father commutes to  the North Side to his store.  
 

If not, then Gilligan admits he might have screwed up the sports  affiliation, and that the store + Jimmy should be White Sox fans.  
 

\* Schweikart &amp; Cokely is supposed to be different than HHM in these ways:  
 

¬† 1)¬† There's two female partners.  
 ¬† 2)¬† The round table, where the board room is, is a contrast to the  rectangular table in the HHM board room.¬† In the round table at  Schweikart &amp; Cokely, everyone can see each other.  
 

The round table is also small, compared to HHM's huge table.  
 

So these things are supposed to provide a different feel.  
 

\* The montage of Jimmy performing various actions to try and get fired  without cause, may have been their hardest montage yet.¬† Even harder  than the ""bar tricks"" montage from 1x10.  
 

\* They had to get clearance for every item in Jimmy's father's shop.¬† Whether it was Nilla Wafers, the Cubs logo, etc.  
 

\* In the writers' room, they think about the Mr. Miyagi quote from ""The Karate Kid"".  
 

""Walk on left side of road, safe.  
 

Walk on right side of road, safe.  
 

Walk in middle . . . squish like grape.""  
 

They think Kim's decision to start her own practice is symbolic of this quote.  
 

They ponder whether she might be the truck driver, but then decide that no, they think she will be the grape.  
 

\* The real estate agent that shows Mike and Stacey the house, is the  same one from Breaking Bad, who confronted Marie about stealing.  
 

\* When Kim is thinking about Chuck's story about Jimmy's father, and how  Jimmy stole from the store, while Kim does think that there is truth to  what Chuck says, she doesn't believe it 100%.

 From the 2x08 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* The opening teaser was done in one shot.¬† Meaning, the camera rolled  continuously.¬† There is one small cut during the sequence.  
 \* The opening teaser was supposed to be about another 1:30 - 2 minutes longer.¬† They cut off the end.  
 

\* The scene at the Dog House was supposed to be longer.¬† They pared it  down so you still got the gist of the scene, which was that Kim wasn't  going to do anything unethical to try and retain Mesa Verde, such as  telling them before she resigned from HHM.  
 

\* The actor who played Fudge, the fake war veteran, actually auditioned  to be on the bus with the other Sandpiper Crossing residents in 2x03.  
 

His audition was unusual, in that he had a pair of sunglasses, and  pulled them off, like it was CSI Miami.¬† And he then put them back on.¬†  It was funny.  
 

But it didn't fit into the way the other residents on the bus were.¬† It was like he was auditioning for a whole different show.  
 

They thought, they have to use him somewhere.¬† So when they wrote the part for the fake war veteran in 2x08, he came to mind.  
 

\* When they initially wrote the scene for the B-29, they thought they were going to just use an image of one.  
 

Then they thought, let's use a real one.¬† So they got the last real B-29, Fifi, to fly to Double Eagle Airport.  
 

Fifi actually travels to different airports.¬† Gilligan recommends that  people ride in it.¬† It's expensive, but worth it, he says.  
 

\* Ariel Levine is writer and post PA.¬† On her own, she researched banking law stuff.¬† And she went to a legal law library.  
 

No one told her to do that.¬† She just did it.  
 

Vince Gilligan then praised her, and said that she is making the most of  her job.¬† He says, too often, there's people that take a job as an  assistant.  
 

Then within 1 - 2 weeks, they're trying to slip the boss a script, or ask when they can direct.  
 

He says they're not paying their dues.  
 

In contrast, he says Ariel went above and beyond her job.¬† And she did that on her own time.¬†  
 

So he praised her work ethic, and desire to pay her dues.  
 

\* Jonathan Banks and writer Thomas Schnauz don't always get along.¬† Banks calls Schnauz the ""Little Prince"".¬†  
 

Schnauz says maybe he'll give Banks even less dialogue, and have more scenes with him just sitting in a car, eating a sandwich. 	    

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 From the 2x09 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* The song in the teaser when the truck driver is driving and singing,  is ""Mi Cucu"".¬† Those lyrics, in English, are ""Don't touch my butt"", ""I  want to touch your butt.""¬† Etc.  
 

\* They're not sure hiding money inside a tire would really work.¬† It  might throw the balance off.¬† Or they say it might not, because the  money would weigh so little.  
 

They also think hiding dope inside a tire wouldn't work, because a drug dog would be able to smell it.  
 

\* When Kim punches Jimmy in the arm, they encouraged Bob Odenkirk to wear padding.¬† He did not.  
 

They said she punches hard, and you might be doing it for 20 takes.  
 

He finally relented.  
 

\* When Chuck falls to the floor, it's actually a safe stunt.¬† There's a  ""single wire"", which makes it so that it looks like he's hitting his  head on the table before he falls, but he doesn't actually it it.  
 

There's also padding underneath the floor.  
 

\* Jonathan Banks is getting his honorary doctorate from Indiana University in humanities.  
 

Banks' great grandfather made his grandfather on his mom's side drop out of school in 6th grade, and work on the farm.  
 

Banks doesn't like his great grandfather because of that.  
 

Banks' grandfather was able to send all of his kids to college, except Banks' mom.  
 

His grandfather had investments that went belly up, during the Great  Depression.¬† And his mom was the youngest, so after the investments went  belly up, they didn't have money for her for college.  
 

His mom started working on her own at 15.¬† She eventually managed to put herself through college at Indiana University.  
 

She eventually became a college professor.  
 

Banks had to drop out of school when he was young, because he got a girl pregnant.¬† So he had to start working.  
 

So that's why Indiana University is special to him, and his family. 	 

&amp;#x200B;

 \* Jonathan Banks:¬† A prequel is better than a sequel.¬† In a sequel, you've already shot your wad with the previous show.  
 

In a prequel, it's about how you got there.¬† And I'm not truly clear how.  
 

Vince Gilligan:¬† Well a sequel to Breaking Bad for you would have sucked.

From 2x10 Insiders Podcast:  
 

\* On Breaking Bad, they were having a hard time casting Elliot.  
 

They were trying to shoot a scene with Walt and Elliot.  
 

Director Adam Bernstein said ""my wife's an actress"".  
 

They ended up changing the scene so it was Walt and Gretchen.¬† They just created her character just then.  
 

And then changed Walt's history so he was engaged to Gretchen before.  
 

\* They thought about using Tuco's shack, out in the desert.¬† However, there wasn't really a good place to snipe over there.  
 

And, the location itself was in terrible shape.¬† It would cost a lot of  time and resources just to get it in shape so it was safe for the  production crew.  
 

So that's why they created a different location, for the shack.  
 

\* The tech scout for that shack, was the hardest tech scout Vince Gilligan has ever done.  
 

A tech scout is where they visit a location, so they can have details on how they will film.  
 

First of all, it was raining hard.  
 

Then, they had to walk a total of 7 miles that day.¬† I guess they couldn't park too close.  
 

Then, a production assistant who was ready to give birth any day, was  with them.¬† Gilligan didn't want to look like a pussy (his words) next  to her.  
 

\* They filmed the scenes with Mike's scope, using the real cross hairs on the scope.  
 

Most of the time, on TV or movies, cross hairs are added in afterwards.¬†  But they figured out a way to film, using the real scope.  
 

They were also thankful that they were allowed to have patience on the  scope scenes, and take their time.¬† Other shows, would have made the  scope scenes faster.  
 

\* This was the first episode of television that co-writer Heather Marion  has ever written.¬† She knew nothing about guns.¬† But she's from  Nebraska, so she talked to people who knew guns.  
 

\* They used a med tech for advice on how Chuck's scene on the gurney  should go.¬† The advice was that this isn't a life or death situation.¬†  So the medical personnel would act calm.  
 

Gilligan wanted a beeping heart monitor.¬† But he was told by the med  tech, that that would be unrealistic, for someone in Chuck's condition.  
 

\* This was the first episode this season that Gilligan directed.¬† He was  not looking forward to it, because it had two hospital scenes  (flashback; and Chuck gurney scene).¬† He thinks hospital scenes are  boring.  
 

Then, after shooting, he thought about how he could make this  different.¬† That's when he had the idea to have it shown upside down.¬†  So Chuck was on top of the screen.  
 

\* They used a Sony a7rII camera attached to the backboard, in a single  shot, to film this.¬† Instead of the usual Red Dragon camera.  
 

\* When Chuck is going through his garage, they are surprised he has a  Mac.¬† Then they think, it might be Rebecca's.¬† They also point out his  oven, in the garage.  
 

They think Chuck is more of a PC guy.  
 

There's not just one Mac, but two Macs, in his garage.  
 

\* They considered having Saul's white Cadillac come from Chuck.¬† But  they couldn't fit a car in the garage, and still show all of the other  stuff that Chuck had packed away.  
 

So they scrapped that idea.  
 

\* They say based on the tape, Chuck might be an even greater con man than Jimmy.  
 

\* This episode was called ""Klick"" for a few reasons.¬† One, in that a  klick is a kilometer in military terms.¬† And maybe that's how far the  shack was, from Mike.¬† But they say it probably was 1000 feet.  
 

Also, the tape recorder makes a ""click"" sound at the end.",Season 2 Insiders Podcast Notes.
1760,betterCallSaul,,"Too much badassery and wholesomeness in one picture, lord help us all üò©"
1761,betterCallSaul,"This [wonderful graphic](https://i.redd.it/gz11spp315ea1.jpg) from [a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/10kn13y/jimmy_getting_rejected_by_kim_in_their_dream/) \- contrasting a subtle callback from Season VI with an earlier moment where Jimmy thirsts over stainless steel office appliances - got me thinking about how *Better Call Saul* uses Jimmy's repeated longing for symbolic material items to reveal his character. I started thinking of examples of this, but quickly realized there were too many to name and that no full account of these instances exists (at least, not one that I could find).

***I then thought perhaps I'd enlist this subreddit's help in listing all the tangible items or experiences - or tangible anything! - that Jimmy talks about desiring*** that may help reveal his vision of ""living your best life.""

Personally, I don't think this little leitmotif throughout the show is meant to show Jimmy is materialistic, not per se. Rather, I think the writers wanted to convey the sense of a man who has a precise, possibly na√Øve, picture in his mind's eye of what it means to be ""living the good life."" As such, the Season VI callback offered above brings this recurring bit to an end when &gt;!Mike delivers the very sort of stainless fridge Jimmy had been lusting over, but to use in the process of carting away Howard body!&lt; . He thus shows both Jimmy and the audience how &gt;!getting that ""best life"" you thought you wanted is meaningless if you sell your soul to do it!&lt;. 

I'm hoping - if folks are interested - we can make a comprehensive list of everything Jimmy references in 11 seasons of television that paints the picture that Jimmy has in his head of the life he wants to be living.

I'll get us started:

1. Jimmy's insistence on having an office in the early seasons, rather than simply admitting he works from home, including maintaining the permanent ruse that his primary office is being painted
2. The cocobolo desk
3. Stainless steel appliances
4. The whole graphical design for Jimmy's joint office with Kim
5. The Zafiro A√±ejo Tequila, and the tequila stopper, became totems of Jimmy's bond with Kim","The Minutiae of McGill: Revealing Character Through the Details of Desire, Large and Small - **Let's Make a List!**"

1766,betterCallSaul,"Sorry for the length and overall rambling.

It is well known this show was split between the Mike storyline and the Jimmy storyline from the beginning.

As the seasons went on with minimal interaction, I would try to envision how they were going to justify this structure by the end. The way these writers work, it would seem unsatisfying to have it just be a matter of plot that ties these halves together; they are always coming at it in a more thematic way. Why do these two men have some kind of fated connection? Can it be summed up in a simple way that proves shoving both their backstories in a single package was achieving something greater than the sum of its parts, storytelling-wise?

Now that we have been able to reflect on the show in its entirety for a while, I think I have landed on something that tracks, to me at least.

&amp;#x200B;

Better Call Saul is essentially the story of Jimmy learning that Mike was wrong all along. And it only ends once he truly comes to realize it.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy did not respect his father, believing him to be too soft and na√Øve. In walks Mike, an older, father type figure who takes shit from nobody and doesn't mind bending the rules. Jimmy assumes he has all the answers. He becomes a ""guide"" or ""sage"" type figure to Jimmy, helping him navigate the criminal world. When Jimmy is blindsided by doubt, PTSD and mental anguish, Mike is who he goes to for advice. And he follows that advice for years. Just keep going, push it all down, one day you won't even think about it. This advice is like a mission statement for what Saul Goodman will come to represent in this story.

Mike was wrong though. It killed him in the end and it left his granddaughter without any of the hard earned money he was justifying his criminal behavior to provide for. He couldn't get off the bad choice road, despite knowing better, and that was his fatal flaw. 

Jimmy eventually, like Kim, has to take himself off the bad choice road before it consumes him. He is finally able to, and that is basically the finale of the show. Thematically, the episode opens in a way to draw attention to Mike slowly becoming aware that he may not have all the answers he thought he did. Jimmy and Mike discuss regrets, and Mike goes as far as saying he wishes he never took that first bribe, never took that first step on the bad choice road.

At that point, Jimmy is still unable to break through and take a good look inside himself, so Mike's vulnerability doesn't land too well on him and he answers with a shallow response showing no introspection. When he finally takes the stand in ""Saul Gone"" though, he is able to surpass Mike's blind spots and evolve. Mike was stuck thinking he cannot get off the bad choice road, his only option is to keep going, and if only he never took that first bribe, he could have never gotten on. The sad truth is that he could have gotten off, he just didn't want to. He was wrong about revenge, just like Jimmy was wrong about it (against Chuck with the insurance, or Howard with the scams); he was wrong about self deception; he was wrong about his own ability to change; he was wrong about a lot. The writers use Papa Varga to show as much with that final gut punch of a conversation between the two of them.

So what purpose did it serve cutting between these two separate character journeys? Because Jimmy had to break free from Mike's perspective. That is the entire story right there in a nutshell. Even the viewer is made to feel like Jimmy does throughout most of the show, that Mike truly DOES have the answers and he is operating morally within a criminal world, and that should be commended. It is only towards the very end, that it seems there is a turn and the POV shifts --- Mike was just a criminal, and him trying to bend his crime towards morality doesn't really mean anything --- he is still just a criminal. Jimmy and Kim learn that, evolve past it, and they are rewarded as being basically the only remaining players still alive, able to recognize the little bit of dignity left in one another -- la cucarachas.",Contextualizing the two halves of the show (Jimmy/Mike) now that it's over
1767,betterCallSaul,"If you look at Tony Dalton‚Äôs portrayal of Lalo its clear hes meant to mirror Jimmy in a lot of ways character-wise, one of the ways this is shown visually is with their hair. It is very similar and they have very similar stature. The difference of Jeff‚Äôs recasting is that he was going to be a foil character to Jimmy, but after the recasting he is more of a lacky for Jimmy, almost like how Jesse was for Walt (since Walt blackmailed him much the same way; Jessie=Jeffie)",I think the main reason they chose Don Harvey over Pay Healy was because he looked more like Jimmy.

Also, I know why Bolsa didn't want the bail money to reach Lalo because Gus was his earner and Lalo was a threat to Bolsa's business. But then again, how did Bolsa know about these things?

1873,betterCallSaul,"I don‚Äôt live in the US so I‚Äôm relatively oblivious to possible political commentary in Breaking Bad/BCS. Could you please share your thoughts? Here are some things I thought of:
1)The 50% off episode could serve to make an argument about whether or not something like legal representation discounts could influence the likelihood of people committing crimes (and, more broadly, the extent to which the legal field should belong to the private sector).
2)The war on drugs is a pretty obvious theme and I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions on what the show actually says about it.
3)In S4E9 one of the panel members asks Jimmy about what law means to him. Also, for some reason, I remembered how during Jimmy‚Äôs trial in S6E13 the judge announces:
&gt; So it's ""United States versus Saul Goodman.""

This could be a formal thing that is said during all federal case trials, but I feel like it was specifically emphasized to show how Saul represents something completely opposite to the law of the USA. What is it exactly?
4) According to [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XVmKljfQ4TM&amp;t=1916s) video by Ological, the imagery of George Washington in S6E4 has its own meaning. I didn‚Äôt quite get it so maybe y‚Äôall could elaborate?

1880,betterCallSaul,"Just a brainstorming session if anything. But let's say that there was a seventh season, one more season to bridge the gap between the end of the 2004 timeline and the start of *Breaking Bad*. What do you think would happen in it?

I think for starters that they probably would've gone a different way with Kim. I say that after having seen [a ficlet](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43189312) that posited the idea of Gus bribing Kim before she has a chance to leave Jimmy in the wake of Howard's death. I could definitely see him doing that because he wants to be certain she doesn't say anything about what happened that night (especially since he spoke to her over the phone). Not sure what would play out differently to still have everything in *Breaking Bad* stay as is, but this would probably make it such that most of ""Saul Goodman"" is just a big mythos that Kim is puppeteering from behind the scenes, instead of something Jimmy created on his own to cope with his heartache.

Over on the drugs side, I could see them tying up a few loose ends with Mike and Gus, like Mike overseeing the new crew that are finishing the lab, or the matter of Tuco finally getting out of jail.

Those are the few things I can see happening in a hypothetical season 7, but I'm sure others have other ideas as to what might happen.",What if there had been a seventh season?

1892,betterCallSaul,"I love this show. I have watched it two times and on both watches I was convinced that that man did just happen to fall like that. 

I am still consuming content on youtube about BCS and after a Video that mentioned this event again vaguely I finally asked myself the question if the fall was actually staged. Looking for the answer online I came across this awfull thread from over five years ago. [Click here to see some Chucks talking down on everyone who didn‚Äôt get it](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/5qr1po/was_the_billboard_a_scam/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

The shaking hands part and the ‚ÄúTook you long enough‚Äù after the fall was just a thank you and banter to me. According to the thread I also missed the moment twice where Jimmy actually admits to Chuck that he staged it, so maybe everyone that didn‚Äôt get it is really just an idiot (on the other hand, Chuck in ‚ÄúChicanery‚Äù also doesn‚Äôt mention this, all he says is ‚ÄúAre you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that. He orchastrated it.‚Äù). Anyway, at this point in the series I personally still believed in Jimmy innocence. I mean this was before the ‚ÄúI know what stopped me, and it‚Äôs never stopping me again‚Äù. The way I interpreted it, the ‚ÄúBillboard stunt‚Äù was just another factor for him to go back to his scam artist ways, because thats what people thought of him anyway (‚ÄúA Lawyer guilty people hire‚Äù).

Can we just reopen this conversation again without passing judgement at those who did not get that the fall was staged. In the end it is just a TV-show thats meant to entertain. Stop telling people how to enjoy their shows. I hope that people who watch BCS in the future who might also have this question come across this thread for clarity rather than the other one. So please guys just be civil, I hope this comminty was able to grow past this behaviour in the last five years!

Cheers",About the billboard stunt
1893,betterCallSaul,,Shot-For-Shot Remake: Better Call Saul - Chicanery
1894,betterCallSaul,"5 and 3 are close runner ups but man what a final season this show has. When I first watched Season 5 I thought there would be no way the show would top it, but I was so wrong. The methodical build up to episode 7 where the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show clash in the biggest way, leaving Howard and Jimmy and Kim's relationship dead, is the climax of the whole show and a damn good one. 

Nacho's send off happened much earlier in the season than I had expected, but it is still insanely well done and a perfect yet heartbreaking end for the character. His final monologue is one of the most memorable parts of the entire BB Universe, and the episode sets the stage for the rest of the season 6 storylines to be the sole focus moving forward. 

Lalo had a good send-off imo, and none of the characters had to be dumbed down for it to work. The show used his showmanship as his downfall. Letting Gus talk for that long made sense, as it would help smooth things over with Eladio considering Gus is their biggest earner. Eladio would also be pissed that Lalo was alive and didn't alert the cartel. The video would help a lot with that. Episode 8 did the most work in pushing Gus towards his Breaking Bad self, he was smart enough to have a plan B in case the final showdown happened in the lab, and it did. After killing Lalo, Gus has time to analyze his mistakes and likely put more trust in Mike over any of his other men, considering Mike will tell Gus when he disagrees with him, not to mention Mike usually gives very good input despite not being a yes man like Victor and Tyrus. 

Kim breaking up with Jimmy during episode 9 made sense, as she still loves Jimmy but realizes they are a danger to themselves and the people around them, although it's too little too late for Howard. 

Now comes the part that I was so worried about for the entire duration of the series, I always worried about Jimmy's transition to Saul making sense. Since Jimmy is so different from Saul, I had always wondered how the writers would push him to fully becoming the character we see in Breaking Bad. Good thing these writers know exactly what they're doing because it made perfect sense. Howard's death and the breakup (mostly the breakup) is what pushed him over the edge. He has nothing left except money, PTSD, and his career as Saul. He has lost every person he has cared about. It makes perfect sense that he would now put all his eggs in one basket so to speak, and fully transform into the Saul Goodman we met in BB. 

The Gene episodes were quite good, especially episodes 12 and 13. It does feel slightly like an epilogue since our main story has concluded by that point, but it is a very well done epilogue. I enjoyed all the cameos (The RV Scene, Jesse and Walt's solo cameos, the Chuck flashback.) The finale was great, but I can see why some people wouldn't like it. I personally really liked Jimmy owning up to his actions in front of Kim. At that point, if he had taken the 7 year deal he would have had nothing when he got out, he would just continue commiting crimes. It's a depressing ending, but the one that makes the most sense for Better Call Saul. Jimmy attempting to put the Saul persona away for good to earn back some self respect and the respect of Kim is the most satisfying way it could have concluded.",Season 6 is the best season

It's harder, I think, to show how a guy goes from being a milqetoast to a successful drug empire sociopath than it is to show how a sociopath from the start gets worse or better by the end. Thus, every plot twist in BB was a little more surprising and thus impactful. Oh shit, no way! was a common respose. And it never seemed unrealistic.  With BCS, we know the destination of most of the show: he becomes Saul.  ""Oh shit, so that's the way it happened"" is the response. But we know what is going to happen.  Walter almost winds up dead and often uses only his wits to survive by the seat of his pants. Meanwhile, while Saul also has some life threatening moments, his survival is expected. So there's that.  Meanwhile, BCS is certainly funnier and slightly more realistic, and they do have Rhea's life at stake as an unknown. Nonetheless, in terms of sheer inventive plotting, I have to give BB the edge.

1945,betterCallSaul,"Breaking Bad: that the Nazis continued to cook meth after stealing about $70,000,000 of Walt‚Äôs money. Hell, that they even stayed in New Mexico after killing two DEA agents is‚Ä¶dumb. 

El Camino: how fortunate that the guys who came to Todd‚Äôs apartment to steal his money came while Jesse was there. And, even better, one was the guy responsible in part for Jesse‚Äôs torture by the Nazis! 

Better Call Saul: Not many complaints in this area, just how smoothly Jimmy‚Äôs schemes always went. Plus, that Howard would ever stop by anyone‚Äôs apartment who once worked for him. Does anyone here have a boss who comes by for a drink etc? Oh‚Ä¶and I guess that Howard, even in the heat of the moment, wouldn‚Äôt be able to prove (especially to Cliff Main) some sort of chicanery was afoot, being perpetrated no doubt by that old scalawag Jimmy McGill.","Looking back, what was the *weakest* plot point in the Breaking Bad Universe?"

Now i wonder which show (on Netflix) would even come close to better call saul.",What Show would you reccomend after watching BCS (and BB)
1950,betterCallSaul,"During the show, HG Wells' 'The Time Machine' novel was shown in multiple scenes.

In the finale, Saul asks multiple people what they would do if they had a time machine.

I think the reason this is shown/asked is because Mike HAS a time machine and tells no one about it.

Think about it. Mike looks physically younger in Breaking Bad which comes AFTER Better Call Saul's timeline. There is literally no other explanation why he has so many wrinkles and liver spots in BCS than in BB.

It all makes sense now.",I've finally figured out the 'Time Machine' symbolism.
1951,betterCallSaul,"Chuck and Hector were by a crowded gas station glory hole and Hector was hogging it. No one would let Chuck in. He was just face-to-face with a particle board divider in the restroom stall. He kept trying to get to the hole, but no one would let up. So he asked, ""Who wants to get chucked?"" No one responded. Again, he asks, ""Who's ready to get chuckfucked?"" Still no response. He looked annoyed. Aggravated, even. All of a sudden, something hit him and he tore two holes in his shirt right by his nipples and yelled out, ""It's chuckin' time!"", and literally thrusted his penis into the wall and broke a hole through the board. Whoever was sucking stopped and went to Chuck. After that, he went home to Rebecca and asked her, ""How many Chucks does it take to fuck a bitch?"" She looked shocked. He then said, ""There's only one Chuck,"" and winked at her. She laughed, something he'd never made her do before. After that, he went crazy, which is what ended their marriage, but not because of his illness. He just started renaming everything with Chuck in it and it drove her crazy. He would change movie titles to things like *The Last Chuck on the Left* and *A Time to Chuck*, and book titles to things like *No Chuck for Old Men*. He even demanded that Howard change the firm's name to CCC (Chuck, Chuck, &amp; Chuck). That was actually going to be the reason Howard forced Chuck out of the firm at the end of Season 3, but Bince changed it to his malpractice insurance rates skyrocketing. Anyway, Rebecca eventually just couldn't take it anymore. The straw that broke the camel's back was when Chuck came home one day and showed her an irrational number beginning in 3.14. He asked her what it was and she said pi. His response: ""It's Chuck.""

- Best case scenario he got off with a few misdemeanors/brief prison stint and would have gone back to scamming with his buddy Marco, sooner or later ending up in more serious legal trouble, particularly with a criminal record it would be harder to find a legitimate job (not that slippin Jimmy cared for legitimate means of making a living)

2002,betterCallSaul,"Kim and Saul divorced after Howard's death, but on a deeper level, Kim divorced Saul because of how far they both declined morally. Part of the reason Saul Goodman became Saul Goodman was because there was nobody to call him ""James McGill""; Kim divorced him, Howard died, and Chuck died. This raises an interesting question: how would ""Breaking Bad"" have transpired if Saul and Kim never divorced?

1. Scenario 1: Kim prevents Saul from building Walt's drug empire. Kim still sees the good in Saul, so she prevents Saul from building Walt's drug empire. She sees how risky drug cartels are, especially seeing what happened after they came into contact with Lalo.
2. Scenario 2: Kim aids in building Walt's drug empire. Kim helps build Walt's drug empire, ordering murders and finding new fronts for the methamphetamine operation. Kim makes blue methamphetamine a global commodity. She also gets Hank fired from the DEA after his altercation with Jesse and frames Hank as the real ""Heisenberg"".

2009,betterCallSaul," The emotoinal reaction that Kim and Saul had toward Hamlin reminded me of the same unreasonable hate that Skyler White and even Anna Gunn herself recieved when Breaking Bad first premired. Watching anything from the Breaking Bad canon does bring up the horrible and intriguing memory of the Breaking Bad audience's reaction toward the Skyler White character. Yet Skyler was most like the audience in that we all really just want safety and normalcy. Howard Hamlin wanted in a way, the same. We can note his calls for peace and seeking of resolution to Jimmy's almost super powered antics. He wanted to treat things in a boring, peaceful manner. Saul and Kim had a deep dislike for Howard due to the percieved slights that Hamlin had thrown their way. Then they run away with their hate due to those slights as well as the communal thrill.  Yet in Better Call Saul that hate is satisfied and eventually spiraled from immature joyful prodding to the serious horror it became. Luckily Skyler's fate was at least a return to something of safety, it's just tragic what happens to Hamlin.",Parallels between Skyler White and Howard Hamlin?

2017,betterCallSaul,"I've watched BB and I just finished ep10 of Season 1 of BCS and that very last scene of the season really got me thinking. Why indeed did Mike not take the money? 

Mike isn't exactly a good guy, from what I understand he was a dirty cop up until his son's death. Then he decided that he's okay with taking illegal jobs that involve stealing or killing (although I don't think up until this point he's killed anyone on one of his jobs), but he wouldn't consider taking some of the money he's actually stolen? 

I'm guessing his moral code has something to do with what he said in an earlier episode, that even if you are a criminal you should always keep your word in a deal, but I felt even that is a bit questionable for him as I remembered him trying to screw Walt over in the Methylamine deal in BB Season 5.

2031,betterCallSaul,"I found the portrayal of old people in Sandpiper a bit annoying. They are shown to be a bit of a caricature, and almost like a comedy relief. They are shown to be too naive, gullible, unaware, etc.

But I think unless they are suffering from a disease, old people are just‚Ä¶ people. In fact, they are often incredibly wise and smart, since they have been around the block. 

Why are people in Sandpiper are portrayed like that? I really found it a significant blemish on an otherwise excellent show.",Portrayal of old people

2035,betterCallSaul,"So did Gus have the tracker put in Mike's gas tank specifically for Mike to find it and meet him in the desert?

The guys who replace the battery have a scene where they meet Gus' street guy and he asks about the battery dying. Did that imply Gus expected Mike to drain it prematurely? So did he know MIke would reverse lookup the product id buy a fake one and replace it to track them back? Then Gus used Mike tracking his men to his advantage.   


Mike then tracks the guy to Los Pollos Hermanos. He hires Jimmy to go in and watch what the guy does with the bag after he gets out of the jeep. He does nothing but eat and leave yet Gus knows Jimmy is working with Mike as he watches them meeting up across the street. Ultimately Gus has Victor pull up to Los Pollos and drive off quickly with the gps tracker pinging to the direction he leaves. This leads Mike to the desert where he sees the cell phone on top of the gas cap and then later first meets Gus.

2042,betterCallSaul,"You should watch BB before BCS to get the most enjoyment out of BCS, but you do not need BB in order to be fulfilled (i.e., receive sufficient enjoyment) by BCS.

Common arguments for why ""you need to watch BB to understand BCS"":

1. Ending of Salamanca-Fring storyline (""without BB the storyline feels inconclusive"")
   1. I'd disagree-- you don't get a conclusion to the storyline in BCS in terms of plot, but you do get it in terms of character. Gus has the opportunity to pursue a relationship but stops himself and pushes himself back into the game to avenge Max. Right afterwards we get the scene between Papa Varga and Mike, where Papa Varga summarizes the game Mike and Fring are in as ""revenge"" that ""never ends."" Jimmy's line in Waterworks about Mike and Fring being ""in the ground"" adds to this material to produce the conclusion; because Mike and Gus are pursuing a game of revenge that never ends, they are killed by gangsters who wanted revenge on them the same way they wanted revenge on the people they hunted throughout BCS. And this is true-- Mike was killed by Walt as revenge for hurting his ego, Gus by Hector as revenge for killing his family. We get an ending that is lacking in plot but has its substance in character, and this is still fulfilling because BCS is a character-based show; all the entertainment comes from character.
2. You won't understand Gus is avenging Max without watching BB
   1. You can...in 5x1 Lalo tells Bolsa he thinks Gus is angry at the cartel for killing his boyfriend and in 5x5 the literal title of the episode basically says he's right.
3. S6E11-13 won't make sense
   1. S11 was created specifically to inform standalone viewers why he ended up on the run in the first place...Saul being told to let Walter White go and him being on the run the next time we see him chronologically aren't dots that are too far away from each other to connect.
4. Breaking Bad references must be understood to enjoy BCS
   1. In what way? Every reference you need to enjoy BCS is explained in the show itself, the ones that aren't explained (e.g.: Tuco telling No-Doze to ""stop helping"") aren't necessary to the plot.",Just because you should watch BB before BCS does not mean BCS isn't standalone

2073,betterCallSaul,"Yes, I finished two seasons in one day. Well, season 4 is definitely keeping things entertaining. While I thought the beginning of the season was a bit slow, the subplot with the Germans working with Gus and Mike was some of my favorite so far. And Werner was a great guy who got wrapped up in the wrong business, really sad to see him go.

Also, Lalo is a LEGEND, so charming and fun but also calculated and terrifying (kind of like everyone else in the series!). I almost wish he was introduced earlier but then again it was very cool knowing he would show up at some point and he‚Äôs definitely my favorite character right now. I‚Äôve been spoiled about many things involving him because the internet is unavoidable so I‚Äôm not completely blind, but the circumstances will be very cool to learn. 

He is a great counter to Mike in the final episode of the season, and I hope to see more of Lalo working against Gus and Mike together. I know Jimmy gets involved with him at some point and he is a real threat, which will be cool to see. Hopefully there is more of hector in this season because I really loved his character.

I never made the connection before. I loved Cranston in Malcolm in the Middle. He made that show for me and made me gut laugh so many times on that series.

Cranston was remarkable playing a serious character like Walt, but still having those comedic roots come out on such a subtle level. Banging away on the pipe trying to stop a minor clicking sound. Breaking down the unfeasibility of a time machine for a thought experiment. After having not seen the character for so long, that scene made me realize there is a lot of Hal in Walt. I guess there's a lot of Bryan in both.

BB was a favorite of mine, never gave BCS a look because I felt it was just some offshoot trying to milk a masterpiece, then got bored and ended up bingeing it. Kudos, the series was brilliant and I'll bet it was a lot of fun on this sub over the past 8 years.",The finale made me realize why Walt is such a great character.
2099,betterCallSaul,"Spoilers for BCS and Breaking Bad ig.

Forgive me for maybe being simplistic here, but as the header suggests, in some way Chuck could be to blame for all hell breaking loose in both shows.

The stimulus for he and Jimmy's war was down to Chuck not wanting Jim to be on the team at HHM for the Sandpiper class action, let alone being a lawyer period.

That leads to Jimmy becoming more of a cynic and having a knife in his back forever. He gets more into the criminal world because he sees no value in himself being a legitimate lawyer and knows what he's good at- he's been given a horrible, but justified, character assassination by his brother and idol, the man he sought to emulate.

The plot happens.

Lalo goes on his mission with the Germans, Saul and Kim destroy Howard and leave HHM an empty building, he eventually finds Walter White and, as we all know, basically crafts him into a kingpin-possibly being responsible for Walt inadvertently causing the plane crash, the Nazi's killing the prisoners, Drew Sharp and Andrea, Hank and Gomie's deaths and the rise of blue sky across Europe.

I'm obviously missing key plot points but it could be said if Chuck had been more welcoming to Jimmy and actually given him where credit was due for turning himself around and bettering himself, and putting him on the Sandpiper team-then all the tragedy of both shows could've ended with one scene.

obviously it's not that cut and dry and Jimmy would've likely fucked it up eventually, as he did in Davis and Main. he'd get bored try to add idiosyncrasies and blow the whole case. but fuck chuck.",Could an argument be made that Chuck is responsible for everything going to shit?
2100,betterCallSaul,"I'm still in the midst of my rewatch of the BB universe, and just finished Chicanery last night. God, it really is an incredible episode.  


I've been thinking a lot about how critical Chuck was of Jimmy being a shady trickster/con artist ‚Äì basically, fooling people by setting plans into motion based on assuming how they'd behave given a few prompts. But Chuck does the same thing all the time ‚Äì most obviously when getting Jimmy to confess to switching the address numbers (which started with playing Ernesto for a fool, too). Chuck and Jimmy really are brothers ‚Äì two sides of the same coin, brilliant and talented at nudging marks to do exactly what they want.  


It reminds me of the moment when Howard puts the key witness in a wheelchair ‚Äì¬†certain types of lies/games/unethical persuasion are perfectly acceptable in even prestigious legal environments.   


Anyway, when I rewatched BB, I was completely anti-Walt, despite rooting for him the first time around.

I do think that without Chuck's betrayals of Jimmy, Saul may never have existed.",Chuck the Con Artist

3: Kim's decision to leave Mesa Verde and all the money only to scam Howard to close the sandpiper case early makes no plot sense.

4: I also missed some part of Lalo and Fring's tactics. Fring goes to length to get Lalo arrested, then doesn't want him to go to prison and gives up 7 mil to get him out of jail to send him to Mexico in his home base to then try and kill him there. It's just bit too much.",Random Thoughts

2113,betterCallSaul,"Totally loving the show so far, breaking bad was excellent and I heard just as great things about BSC as well. I heard many people saying it was kind of slow and less exciting, but I totally disagree - some parts were slower than others but I really enjoy the crime drama kind of element and there‚Äôs plenty of action to be had. 

I kind of saw chucks death coming, and it was pretty sad but I did kind of feel he got what he wanted and he said what he wanted to say all along. I understand why he did it but it‚Äôs still no less heartbreaking, to see a man lose himself after Jimmy both screwed him over and cared for him through it all at the same time.

2144,betterCallSaul,"I love the way BCS tells its story, it‚Äôs poetic &amp; beautifully done. The writing is honestly better than Breaking Bad but since I am more into action dramas &amp; the writing is obv incredible I still prefer BB. It‚Äôs the best show I‚Äôve ever seen. But BCS really does a great job of capturing the same tension in a different way. 

Season 5 is amazing, especially cuz of how action packed/eventful it is. I think it probably feels the most like a season of Breaking Bad (not saying it needs to be BB to be good, again it just comes down to my personal preference) 

Season 6 is also amazing. The tension is just through the roof in both storylines. The Howard scheme was so well done, I was on the edge of my seat &amp; his death was such a twist for me. I loved how they basically gave us an action packed, intense Breaking Bad-esque climax while maintaining the BCS style through the first 9 eps, then for the last 4 Gene eps they committed to the subtlety &amp; truly gave us a BCS style climax. Sure it‚Äôs not as eventful as the first half, the pre BrBa era climax, but you‚Äôre enthralled watching Gene who is just so far gone at this point, &amp; you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat wondering if he‚Äôs gonna get caught &amp; how the trial is gonna play out. 

Honestly S6 is definitely more well written as far as the story they chose to tell, but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice a couple decisions I would‚Äôve done differently. 

1. I loved Nacho‚Äôs ending but it came too soon, I think it would‚Äôve been better if he was somehow involved in taking down Lalo. After the buildup &amp; cliffhanger in season 5, not having Nacho &amp; Lalo face off felt like a bit of a missed opportunity. They could‚Äôve just had Gus frame him for killing Lalo &amp; we still could‚Äôve gotten his incredible final scene in the desert. 

2. Also as much as I LOVED the Gus killing Lalo scene, I think Mike could‚Äôve benefitted from that more. I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs a problem or anything, but I guess they wanted to give Gus a big action moment since Mike already has had a few, like the Bagman ep for example. 

3. Also I don‚Äôt have a problem with alluding to the BB era through flashbacks but I do think we could have benefitted from an ep fully set in that part of the timeline. I didn‚Äôt need more of Walt &amp; Jesse, but Saul had a ton of other clients in BB, so using one of those cases to flesh out the state of Saul in BB would‚Äôve helped connect the 2 stories for me personally. We only ever see him through Walt‚Äôs perspective in BB, you would never think he‚Äôs as broken as you realize he was after watching BCS. 

4. Lastly, getting Mike to do more P.I. work for one of Saul‚Äôs cases would‚Äôve been a perfect opportunity to flesh out the state of their relationship during BB. Mike is a lot colder to Saul in BB than he is to Jimmy in BCS. 

S5 on the other hand, I just think is straight up incredible &amp; I wouldn‚Äôt really change anything about it tbh. 

So which do you prefer? Sorry this got longer than I intended so thank you if you‚Äôre still reading.",Which do you prefer? Season 5 or 6?
2145,betterCallSaul,"I'm on my 3rd watch through now , and I can't help but feel so bad for Werner.

What would happen to Kim?? Would she have some sort of charges filed against her??

She did actually murder someone but she did it on orders of a man she just watched murder someone right in front of her. However, it was not actually *her* life in danger it was Jimmy's life she was trying to save... So what would that mean for Kim if the police believed Kim when she said that she had to kill the Gus lookalike because she truly believed that Lalo would kill her husband if she didnt kill him??",What would happen to Kim???

This scene has stuck with me since the show ended. Chuck‚Äôs entire purpose in life was to become a great lawyer, and he succeeded, but in the end how much did it really matter? He had no friends, no wife, no kids, and no meaningful relationships. No one will ever remember how smart he was or how hard he worked, despite how hard he tried to leave behind a legacy. In the end it seemed that Howard was the only one still carrying Chuck‚Äôs memory.

2165,betterCallSaul,"Two weeks before Christmas last year, I started to rewatching both Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad for the first time in order. When it came to BCS, last week I stopped after seeing Kim leave Jimmy, the time skip of Jimmy as 100% Saul Goodman in his office and the flashback of Jimmy and Kim signing their divorce papers and Kim met Jesse, and immediately transitioned to Breaking Bad

Yesterday I restarted season 2 involving Tuco's death and I have to say as good as Breaking Bad is on it's own, Better Call Saul has made the viewing experience for Breaking Bad insanely better in my opinion. So much context is going on. In the background as you get to know Walt and his family again, Jimmy is in the background still hiding from the pain and trauma he's been through as Saul, his loose ties to Gus, Mike working for Gus as well as Jimmy before seeing them again Cheryl grieving over Howard still, probably. Then when you get to Tuco's death episode in Breaking Bad while also seeing Hector again who looked awful, it's amazing

For Tuco he's a rabid dog hooked on Walt's meth, emotionally unstable and extremely more dangerous than he was when you first saw him in Better Call Saul before being put away. Even in the opening of season 2, Hank briefly mentions the story Nacho told Mike in season 2 of Better Call Saul about Dog Paulson. Hector? Well we all know what happened to him. Nacho put him that chair and Gus ensured Hector stayed in the chair permanently preventing Hector from able to learning to walk and talk again. I bet Hector was thinking of Nacho constantly 

So much depth, context and continuity, I cant wait till I get to Walt meeting Gus again, Jimmy back in the fold as Saul and of course Mike. Bravo, Vince",Rewatching Breaking Bad after starting with most of BCS

2214,betterCallSaul,"I have two questions regarding Gus planting the gun in the lab. Why would Gus anticipate himself being in the lab with Lalo considering the lab is well guarded? We now know Gus was right to plant the gun, but from his perspective in 605 it seems like a stretch for him to be thinking this way. The only thing I could think of that would justify his logic would be that he expected Lalo to kill all the guards that were there (counting the ones that were lured away in the 608 situation) and then after the guards were killed Lalo would find him and bring him to the lab, which is a crazy stretch imo. 

My second question is, why did Gus not have another gun on him? For some reason this man who has all the firepower in the world has one gun and he puts it in the lab, and doesn't get a second one to replace it so he himself can be armed at all times? It seems very strange that Gus plants his only gun in a hole far away from his house and doesn't get another one for his own person. Can someone help me out with these two questions?",Gus logic

Here's my question: I know BCS is a show full of twists and turns, and I know nothing happens without a reason. We saw the house go on fire, but not Chuck. We also never see Chuck's body; Hamlin says ""Jimmy, don't"" when Jimmy approaches the coroner's van. The funeral also appears to be closed casket.

So is it possible that Chuck isn't actually dead? And is it possible that him and Hamlin set the whole thing up to get revenge on Jimmy? If so, how? Will Chuck run into his house in the middle of the night and yell ""CHICANERY"" and then disappear, making Jimmy think he's hearing ghosts (again, I think this could be very funny)? Or will Hamlin, in his future conversations with Jimmy, say things like ""Chuck just told me--"" and when Jimmy says ""huh?"", Hamlin will say, ""Oh sorry, nothing"" to fuck with Jimmy's head.

2233,betterCallSaul,"Okay, so there's just a couple of points in season six that I couldn't quite figure out when I was watching the episodes. I'm sure someone here will be able to help me out.

The first part I'm confused about is the part early on with Lalo and the peasant couple. Shortly after he's escaped the hitmen, he ends up at this humble shack with this man and woman who know him. The thing is, it seems heavily implied that he stabs them both to death with a scissors. If so, why does he? They seemed to be friendly with him and/or fear him. If it was money he needed, I'm sure he could have gotten it from them without killing them.

The second thing is when Lalo is in the sewer, checking out Fring's operation with his video camera and telling his uncle how he's going to get in there and collect evidence that will prove Fring is two-faced. But then he stares into space for a moment, like he's just realizing something, and then he mutters ""clever chicken man"", and then he flips out and smashes a chair against the wall a few times, and then he tells his uncle that he's gonna have to just go ahead and kill Fring.

I am currently watching again Better Call Saul and i found something ""funny"" about Season 4 Episode 10. For those who do not remember it is the scene where Chuck and Jimmy sing *The Winner takes it all.* When they come back from the party before going to bed, the two brothers have a discussion about how it would be more symmetrical if HHM became HHMM because Jimmy had become a lawyer now.  

It clicked for me this time because at the time I had loved to discover the music *""The winner takes it all""* and I was very interested in the music of the group ABBA which is ... perfectly symmetrical.

No one‚Äôs moving on  

He‚Äôs seething seeing your grown success  
Cuts you down with a pompous breath  
A whisper to the chosen one  
A Sisyphusian life begun  

You swallow your pride  
Swallow your soul  
To keep the guilt from taking hold  
Believe it‚Äôs nothing wrong with you  

Every time he wants to breathe  
He smacks himself down to his knees  
A little slice of heaven just for you

When Nacho's father visits his son, they argue, then he is frustrated and leaving but says ""Goodbye young lady"" to the girl who is most likely paid by Nacho to live with him and have sex. It's very obvious who is that girl and why she is here, but Nacho's father doesn't ignore her and just leave, he sees her as a human being that should be respected as others; he also doesn't put his anger on that girl who is actually inoccent in what Nacho does. I think most people on Nacho's father's place would have been angry at that girl too, or wouldn't mind her existence at all, because sex workers are mostly seen dehumanized. I think that gesture emphasises Nacho's father's humanity and decency.

2320,betterCallSaul,"I apologize in advance if this is not as well worded as it otherwise would be, but I'd like to voice a complaint I have with the show

I actually prefer seasons 1-3 over 4-6

The pacing, cinematography, and writing all flowed together very naturally, while the latter seasons felt like an imitation.

If i had to give a reason for these, I'd say it's because the show insists upon itself. For the characters, the show asks you to care because you care, rather than giving you a reason. It's nonstop of cool characters doing cool things with the audience pointing and going ""HOLY SMOKES ITS THAT CHARACTER FROM THE OTHER SHOW DOING SOMETHING COOL""
It feels aware of it's reputation, and uses it.

Pacing - again, it feels like an imitation. Breaking Bad was somewhat slow, but could be argued that it's to show the natural proggresion and inner conflict of our characters, mostly walt. In BCS, it drags it out so far we have 5-10 minute shots of people just sitting or thinking or kim wexler throwing out a fucking cup.

Cinematography - again, it's purposeful, but doesn't mean its super deep. A shot I'll use is Oakley talking to Saul and it has only shots of one or the other to show their moral duality. It's a technique that's obvious it hits the viewer of the head and distracts from the show. Rather than showing the point it's trying to make, it tells us the point it's trying to make. It insists upon itself.

I know i sound like a jackass, i promise this is strongly worded but i still like the show. I just, it feels like an imitation, and i couldnt figure out why. But then i looked up the writing and say vince was responsible for seasons 1-2 and some of 3, with gould primarily taking over the rest of the show.
I still like goulds writing and not a bince purist, but definitely prefer vinces.


Let me know what you think, thank you!",not a fan of seasons 4-6 as much. it feels like an imitation and I'll explain why

2324,betterCallSaul,"Probably already said but if you look up closely to Lalo's murders or when he could and didn't kill, you will discover that he never kills if it's not unavoidable necessity for certain rational reasons from his perspective. He could have killed Frau Zigler in order to break into her house, but he waited instead; killing her was unnecessary so he haven't done it. Also, he could blow up illegal migrants' truck like twins did but he still didn't, because there was no need. He feels zero empathy for people, but on the other hand, he has no interest in killing around carelessly and unnecessarily. This trait also distiguishes Lalo from other Salamancas. Anyone who he has killed was either his enemy, a witness or danger for him in another way. Even migrant transfer guys, killing them seems avoidable if you don't consider disrespect enough for it, but as I see, it was more than that - Lalo was faking his death and he couldn't let himself left in the desert like this. We don't know how or where he got money without showing up, maybe he didn't have enough money with him and he needed that transfer money to get other money in order to fulfill his plans.

He's always been someone who makes grand gestures regardless of the consequences, he's not super careful and methodical like Gus or Mike, he's a big dramatic showman. This is a man who willingly went to bat for the two skater kids who were going to be killed by Tuco, even though he was risking Tuco's wrath. He confessed to Chuck that he switched the numbers at the end of season 2 to make Chuck feel better, even though he was risking going to prison over it.

2430,betterCallSaul,"Sooo, I just finished this series. I'm not a big TV binger, but man this show had me compelled to the last episode. Incredible television. My thoughts: 

**The cartel story:** 

I preferred the cartel storyline with Mike to the Jimmy storyline. Nacho's storyline had notes of Leonardo DiCaprio's storyline from the departed, really enjoyed it, and ultimately him sacrificing himself for his father was a sad and satisfying conclusion to his storyline - the moral was ""crime doesn't pay if you can't protect your family"" and it felt true. 

Lalo is probably the best TV villain of all time. Incredible performance from Tony Dalton. I felt like he was a mirror image to Jimmy - Lalo, like Jimmy, is highly articulate, loves to talk and use the force of personality when doing business, and he was capable of anything at any moment.  It was a new kind of villain  for me, and I loved it. 

The Jimmy storyline was a mixed bag for me.

**the good:** 

 I liked that Jimmy was an underdog that enjoyed disrespecting authority. The Chuck storyline was tragic and very relatable- being sabotaged, discouraged, envied by family members that you admire is toxic and has toxic ripple effects. And I felt the reason that Chuck resented Jimmy, that deep down, Chuck resented Jimmy being mother's favorite, and being spoiled by their mother made Jimmy charismatic and lovable, while C

**what I didn't. care for:**  

**Rushed character change:**  One moment Gene's having panic attacks fearing for his life at cinnamon, the next he's fearlessly starting a crime ring, and we learn he's a misanthrope he feels no guilt or shame for hiding behind naive pawns. the transition felt rushed. Season 6 should have been entirely about Gene so this could play out properl

**Jimmy asks for the maximum prison sentence (and gets it):** I liked the theme of accountability and the concept you can't improve without being accountable- that was great.  but the ending really romanticized punitive justice, that it to say:  punishment by imprisonment is good, and accepting imprisonment is morally correct. Yeah yeah, you could say he had fans in prison. I still say Jimmy would be the victim of unspeakable violence in prison.  It made me sad to see it dramatized as a romantic path to redemption. 

**Conclusion:**  Enjoyed the show as its own thing. It definitely had the magic of breaking bad in that I couldn't wait to see what happened next every episode, and it never got repetitive. Also, they never disappointed me as a fan of Breaking Bad, it was very respectful of the canon while being its own thing. Anything that can make me forget about my own problems for 60+ hours without the use of drugs (ha!)  is pretty incredible.","Just binged all of BCS for the first time, thoughts [spoilers]"

2445,betterCallSaul,"Footsteps sounds in both BCS and BB. So satisfying in every scene, bravo to the foley artists.",Let's take a moment to appreciate this.
2446,betterCallSaul,"I'm on my third watchthrough since the show started, but this is only my second time going through the series since it finished this past year. I used to think season 1 was pretty slow and didn't pack the punch the later seasons did, but god, with the context we have now the last few episodes are absolutely brutal.  &gt;!Seeing Howard covering for Chuck is absolutely gut-wrenching knowing his fate, how he's constantly being dragged left and right by the McGill brothers and is just doing his best.!&lt; On top of that, seeing Jimmy and Chuck getting along and working together so well for almost an entire episode is just tremendously sad. I know it's more nuanced than this, but to me it really feels like Chuck torpedoes any chance of Jimmy being a good lawyer by not allowing him to be a good lawyer here. Everything with Sandpiper was completely clean, and Chuck knew that, but still can't stomach it. I've seen people say that Chuck is right about Jimmy being a lawyer is like a ""chimp with a machine gun"", but it's clear to me that when Chuck reinforced Jimmy's good lawyer behavior they were both better for it. Jimmy wasn't scheming and Chuck's mental health was recovering. It's genuinely sad that Chuck couldn't see that. Chuck hurting Jimmy sends him to Cicero looking to pick up the pieces of himself, and Marco almost immediately spoonfeeds Jimmy values that he held as Slippin' Jimmy that eventually become the hallmarks of Saul Goodman. Jimmy finding absolute acceptance from Marco, only for him to die, shows Jimmy who he really wished he had been around the past 10 years instead of being on ""probation"" with Chuck. God.  


I know this is kind of all over the place but Season 1 used to just be more of a segue into the rest of the show for me, but for the first time, watching Jimmy drive away and hum Smoke on the Water just broke me. I cried 3 different times in the last 2 episodes and am not sure how I'm going to get through Chuck and Jimmy singing karaoke this time around.",Season 1 is Devastating After Watching the Full Show

He refused to tell his Jimmy's mother's last words, and despite Jimmy's constant charitableness he's still rude to him. He's just outright selfish and cold hearted",Is it just me or is chuck a really hateable character?

I love the various points of the show where Chuck ignores his ‚Äúcondition,‚Äù especially when it comes to putting down his brother by any means necessary.

2454,betterCallSaul,"So after the breaking bad universe ended I still have a few questions that I think need to be answered

#1.Is Chuck aware that Kim or Jimmy are dating?

During Plan And Execution, Howard knows that Kim and jimmy are a couple, but has Chuck, Or anyone else from hhm even known that Kim and jimmy were dating?


#2.How Did Neil And Casey Know Where The Money Was

All the police officer asked about is to turn off the radio and stay in his car but walt for no reason decides to yell at the officer and then rants about how he has rights, was there any reason why he did this?

#4.What happened to Ed Galbraith after better call saul?

During the chase scene in S6E13:Saul Gone, Gene takavic ends up in a Dumpster and tries to call Ed and accidentally spills diamonds everywhere and the police finally arrests gene, but we never know what happened to the card that had Ed's number on it, did the police find the card and arrested Ed for sneaking criminals across states? We know that Ed's business is so secure that he can bring police officers to his business without breaking a single sweat so maybe he wasn't caught??

#5.What happened to badger and skinny Pete after el camino?

After jesse leaves badger and skinny Pete's house, we never know happened to the two after el camino, we know that their plan to trick the police into thinking that Jesse's in Mexico worked, but we never what happened to them after the series ended

#6.How did gus know his car had a bomb on it?

During S4E12:End Times, Walt tries to kill gus Fring by planting a bomb on his car but gus suddenly stops and looks out and walks away, leaving walt disappointed but how? How did gus know that walt was trying to kill him?

#7.How did Chuck not feel anything when talking to Jimmy during the beginning of S3E3:Sunk Costs?

If Chuck has a condition which makes sensitive to electricity which also makes unable to go outside, how come he didn't feel anything when talking to jimmy?

#8.Where does the flashback with Mike Ehrmantraut take place?

In the beginning of el camino, Jesse Pinkman and Mike Ehrmantraut are talking to each other across a River and I've always wondered where the flashback takes place at, at first I was thinking s5e6:Buyout, but I'm pretty sure jesse and Mike didn't have time to talk to each other after witnessing a kid being Murdered

#9.how come Krazy-8 didn't die from the phosphine gas walt made?

There's never really an explanation for this, Krazy 8 somehow comes back from the dead all of a sudden

#10.Was Gene actually gonna kill Marion?

During the penultimate episode of better call saul, there's a tense scene between gene and Marion after she finds out that gene is saul goodman and gene then grabs a cable wire and starts to get close to Marion and it has a vibe that Marion might die from the hands of saul goodman, but was gene actually gonna do it or was it just a intimidation tactic that he used on her?

#11.Where would jesse have time to write the letter he send to brock?

There's nothing really much to say here, where would jesse have the time to write a whole letter to brock?

#12.What happened to Walt's Money after it was taken by Jack and Todd?

After Ozymandias Jack Welker and Todd Alquist End up taking Walt's money and Jack leaves him a barrel just for walt, but what happened to the other barrels of cash that got stolen from him?

Episode 9 of season 6 showed something regarding Gus, essentially that he'd won. He put Hector in a chair and made him irrelevant in the Cartel leadership, he'd take swaths of Salamanca territory, and killed the most formidable of the family. All things considered, he achieved his revenge against Hector. He could've stopped building the superlab and quietly run his territory for the rest of his life, spending his days drinking wine and being gay with bartenders (lol Gus slay). 

But no, he didn't just want revenge, he wanted to destroy Hector, the Salamanca family, and the Cartel at large. Nothing could right his loss until every last one of them was dead, and the product of his former partner was in full force. Although a part of him clearly wanted to go back to living a normal life, the emptiness of his partner's absence could never be filled.",My Thoughts on Gus's Final Appearance in BCS

I gotta say, this show is a masterpiece, from the incredible acting to the intricate plot and character development. I mean, the way Walter White goes from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord is just mind-blowing.

And don't even get me started on Jesse Pinkman. He starts off as this low-level dealer, but over the course of the series, he becomes one of the most complex and sympathetic characters on the show.

And let's not forget about the supporting cast. Mike, Gus, Hank, and Saul are all such well-written and interesting characters in their own right.

But what really sets Breaking Bad apart is the attention to detail. From the scientific accuracy of the cooking process to the hidden symbolism in the cinematography, every aspect of the show is meticulously crafted.

30,breakingbad," From all of the main cast, everyone except Walter Jr did many bad things but once they knew the real identity of Walter White, it was like all of their sins just vanished because there‚Äôs a meth maker with an unknown history in the family and it‚Äôs somehow for some reason suddenly by far the worst person in your family tree. Now I‚Äôll break down the characters and why their sins shouldn‚Äôt have been forgotten.  
 

**Skyler White** ‚Äì Convinced White to go through the Leukaemia process *(or whatever it was, sorry.)* without giving a second thought of the financial struggle. It‚Äôs true that a life should be taken priority over money, but money can tear down families for present and future generations as well. Walter knew the consequences which is why he was first set against it, however he thought of his own way into making money from which apparently saddened Skyler more than ever upon realising where it was coming from. She feared her family would be set in danger and yet she decided to get involved in this matter by becoming the laundry boss. It was ironic when Skyler cheated White with Ted because I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the ‚Äúfeel alive‚Äù thing she wanted as well and her birthday song made me question that she had a thing for him before the meth shenanigans. Oh yeah and who needs evidence, White Killed Hank because everyone thinks and says so and White wanted him dead, yes. So therefore trying to kill White with a knife justifies everything.  And let‚Äôs not forget her trying to kill herself and smoking while being pregnant. Yeah, what a great wife and mother she is.  
 

**Jesse Pinkman** ‚Äì his character development makes almost no sense. Starts as a street junkie and abandons his first group *(like, poof gone, not a single thought of that gang)*, becomes once again Walter‚Äôs student, develops into a drug addict, is convinced by White to start rehabilitating. Somewhere along the lines is betrayed by his own family who give focus more to his younger brother. A similar aged kid also kills one of his close gang members, but FOR SOME REASON cannot stand when a kid gets murdered. Dude, I would despise children at this point, plus that‚Äôs how cartels work man, get over it, you two with White committed murder from the very beginning and somehow towards the end does you don‚Äôt want to accept blood money anymore? ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just hang around with Mike, surely that hitman is a completely innocent guy.‚Äù Then he turns against White who became the next Gus, forgetting every time White saved his life.‚Äù He had his chance to start a new life but for the sake of plot rather common sense, nope, got to expose White for what he is even though Jesse didn‚Äôt really do jack shit against Gus and left it all to White to retaliate. 10/10, would recommend to another partner.  
 

**Hank Schrader** \- Do me a favour and bring a law expert here, you‚Äôd be amazed how many times this guy breaks them.  Forging evidence? Not a problem if it‚Äôs honest police work. And speaking of work, what a great working guy, so great that he‚Äôs been called an A-hole numerous times by his pal Gomez. *(I‚Äôll be honest, I thought that Gomez would turn against him at one point‚Ä¶.)*. Very dedicated husband to Marie, so great that he‚Äôll turn a blind eye every time she steals something. Clear example how you‚Äôre willing to forgive every mischief when it comes to your beloved ones, except if you happen to be Heisenberg‚Ä¶  
 

**Marie Schrader** ‚Äì A kleptomaniac without a shred of guilt. Never even considered apologizing or at least admitting stealing the tiara that almost got Skyler facing prison. ‚ÄúWhat, Walter White is part of a cartel? Oh no, that must be so horrible, I got to take Skyler‚Äôs baby away without her consent!‚Äù  
 

**Walter White** ‚Äì Adding him because his character development is also flawed. Season 4 ended, Gus is dead, Walter White is not forced to cook anymore, so he quit, settled back to live with his family happily ever after. The end.  
Sike, season 5, Walter White wants to cook again because what, makes him feel alive? You‚Äôve suffered through 4 seasons, got more money than you can spend and now you want to put your family in danger again? Was that cancer speaking or was that the plot demand, I‚Äôll never know.",Is it me or Breaking Bad is the greatest example of ‚ÄúWe live in a society.‚Äù

84,breakingbad,"I'm well aware this isn't a new take but after casually discussing this show with a couple people I feel the need to explain this here and get it off my chest.

I get it, Walter's a badass, we root for him to stay alive n everything because he's our protagonist, he *is* the show. But holy shit, he's evil. And not in the caricatural notion of evil where he does all this unprovoked bad stuff just to be bad. We see where his morals lie, protecting Jesse, protecting his family, all on top of protecting himself (although, side note, sometimes I wonder if he genuinely cares about Jesse as a person or if Jesse's just his security blanket at this point).

He's not a hero though, he is not a role-model character, people that look up to Heisenberg are so weird to me. There are tons of examples of his evildoings like watching Jane die &amp; sending Jesse to off Gale, just a couple off the top of my head.

But what's interesting to me is that everyone seems to forget when he raped Skyler?? Like I get it she's annoyed the majority of fans (I personally don't find her likeable but her character could've been worse, I mean she *was* down to be Walt's partner in crime essentially) but that scene was so wretched, I dropped the show twice because of that episode (granted I'm glad I stuck it through because of the masterpiece that is the writing) but given that we were barely two seasons in, so we're still being introduced to the villain that is Heisenberg, I couldn't get behind rooting for a protagonist like this. That scene made me sick, I'm honestly shocked that people just brush it aside when discussing his character. This isn't like Hank's mistreatment of Marie due to his injury, Walter White's has the capacity of rape within him, plain and simple. I refuse to believe I'm alone in this. Literally the scene is sickening, I had to skip that episode and read a synopsis to carry on with the show. 

I vaguely understand, what he did to Skyler doesn't compare to murder but why does this incident get brushed off so often??

148,breakingbad,"Once bitter rivals, Walter White and Gustavo Fring have now formed an unlikely alliance. After the death of his wife, Skyler, and the collapse of his drug empire, Walter found himself alone and in need of a new partner. He approached Fring with a proposal - they should join forces and take over the entire drug trade in New Mexico.

Fring was skeptical at first, but he saw the potential in Walter. Together, they started working on a new recipe for their signature blue meth, one that was even more potent and addictive than before. The profits began pouring in, and their business grew stronger every day.

As their partnership flourished, Walter began to see Fring in a new light. He admired his intelligence, his discipline, and his unwavering loyalty to his employees. And, surprisingly, he found himself developing feelings for him. He realized that he had fallen in love with Gustavo Fring.

At first, Walter was hesitant to act on his feelings. He was afraid that Fring would reject him or worse, betray him. But as time went on, he couldn't deny his attraction any longer. One day, he gathered the courage to confess his love to Fring, who was taken aback but intrigued.

After some hesitation, Fring agreed to give their relationship a chance. They started dating in secret, meeting up in private and keeping their feelings hidden from the world. But as their bond grew stronger, they knew that they couldn't keep it a secret forever.

One day, Walter proposed to Fring, and they decided to get married in a small ceremony. It was a quiet affair, attended only by a few close friends and family members. But to Walter and Fring, it was the happiest day of their lives.

Their marriage brought them even closer together, and they became the ultimate power couple in the drug world. With their combined expertise, they were unstoppable. But their love was not meant to last.

One day, while on a business trip, Fring was assassinated by one of his rivals. Walter was devastated by the loss of his beloved husband and vowed to avenge his death. He went on a rampage, taking out anyone who was responsible for Fring's murder. It was a violent and bloody affair, and Walter knew that he had crossed a line.

In the end, Walter was consumed by his desire for revenge, and his empire crumbled around him. He was eventually caught by the authorities and sentenced to life in prison.

TLDR: Gustavo gets resurrected with no explanation and somehow teams up with Jesse to steal back his business and money, before getting captured and then blowing them up or something.

 

Title: ""Resurrection""

FADE IN:

EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

The sun sets over the desert landscape as we see Gustavo Fring walking down a dirt road. He looks exactly as he did before his death, completely unharmed.

GUSTAVO: (to himself) I'm back.

CUT TO:

INT. A SMALL MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Gustavo enters the room and sits down at a small table. He pulls out a burner phone and dials a number.

VOICE ON THE PHONE: (OS) Hello?

GUSTAVO: It's me.

VOICE ON THE PHONE: (OS) Gustavo? How is this possible?

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Let's just say I have a friend in a high place.

VOICE ON THE PHONE: (OS) What do you want?

GUSTAVO: I want back in the game. I want everything that was taken from me.

VOICE ON THE PHONE: (OS) I can't just hand everything over to you. There are people who have taken over your territory.

GUSTAVO: (leaning forward) I'll take care of them.

CUT TO:

EXT. A DRUG LAB - DAY

A group of men in hazmat suits are cooking meth in a large industrial facility. Gustavo, wearing a suit and tie, walks into the lab.

GUSTAVO: (to the men) I'm taking over this operation. You can leave now or stay and work for me.

The men, intimidated by Gustavo's presence, quickly leave.

Gustavo inspects the lab and nods his head in approval.

CUT TO:

INT. A BAR - NIGHT

Gustavo is sitting at the bar, sipping on a drink. A man, who we recognize as Todd, approaches him.

TODD: Gustavo Fring. I heard you were dead.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) I guess rumors of my demise were greatly exaggerated.

TODD: (sitting down) So, what brings you back to Albuquerque?

GUSTAVO: (sipping on his drink) I have some unfinished business to attend to.

TODD: (nodding) I know how that feels. Maybe we can help each other out.

Gustavo looks at Todd with interest.

CUT TO:

INT. A LARGE OFFICE - DAY

Gustavo is sitting across from a group of men in suits. They are clearly nervous to be in his presence.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Gentlemen, it's good to see you.

MAN 1: (stammering) Mr. Fring, we didn't expect to see you here.

GUSTAVO: (leaning forward) I'm here to make a deal. You're going to give me back everything that was taken from me, or there will be consequences.

The men, intimidated by Gustavo's presence, quickly agree to his terms.

CUT TO:

INT. JESSE PINKMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jesse is sitting on his couch, watching TV. The doorbell rings, and he goes to answer it. He is surprised to see Gustavo standing on his doorstep.

JESSE: (stammering) Gustavo? But you're dead.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Not anymore. I need your help, Jesse.

Jesse looks unsure.

GUSTAVO: (continuing) I need you to help me take back what's mine. And in return, I'll help you get your life back on track.

Jesse looks at Gustavo with a mix of fear and desperation.

CUT TO:

INT.

 

A LARGE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Gustavo and Jesse, dressed in dark clothes, walk through the empty warehouse. They are carrying duffel bags filled with weapons and explosives.

GUSTAVO: (whispering) This is it. This is where they're holding my money and my drugs.

JESSE: (whispering) You sure about this, man? I mean, I know we have a deal, but I didn't sign up for this kind of shit.

GUSTAVO: (putting a hand on Jesse's shoulder) I know it's not easy, but we have to do this. Trust me, Jesse.

Jesse nods his head, and they continue walking through the warehouse until they reach a heavily guarded door.

GUSTAVO: (whispering) This is it. Get ready.

Gustavo and Jesse quickly take out the guards and blast the door open with explosives. They enter the room, and Gustavo is pleased to see his money and drugs stored neatly on shelves.

But before they can celebrate, they are ambushed by a group of armed men.

Gustavo and Jesse engage in a brutal firefight, taking out the men one by one. But just as they think they've won, they hear the sound of a helicopter approaching.

GUSTAVO: (yelling) We have to get out of here, Jesse!

They grab the duffel bags and run out of the warehouse. As they run, they see a helicopter landing on the roof of the building.

GUSTAVO: (panting) It's the DEA. We have to get out of here.

Jesse looks at Gustavo with fear in his eyes.

JESSE: (yelling) We're screwed, man. We're gonna get caught!

But Gustavo doesn't give up. He sees a car parked nearby and runs towards it with Jesse in tow.

GUSTAVO: (yelling) Get in the car, Jesse! We're not going down like this!

They get in the car and speed off, leaving the DEA agents behind.

CUT TO:

INT. GUSTAVO'S OFFICE - DAY

Gustavo is sitting at his desk, counting his money. Jesse is standing beside him, looking at the stacks of cash in amazement.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) We did it, Jesse. We took back what was mine.

JESSE: (smiling) Yeah, we did.

Gustavo stands up and walks over to Jesse.

GUSTAVO: (putting a hand on Jesse's shoulder) And now it's time for me to fulfill my end of the deal. What do you want, Jesse? What can I do for you?

Jesse looks at Gustavo, tears in his eyes.

JESSE: (whispering) I just want to start over, man. I want to forget about all of this and start fresh.

Gustavo nods his head, understanding.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Then let's do it. Let's start fresh.

FADE OUT.

 

FADE IN:

EXT. A NEW TOWN - DAY

Gustavo and Jesse are driving into a new town, a small, peaceful community with friendly-looking people walking around. They pull up to a small house with a ""For Rent"" sign in front.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) This is it, Jesse. Our fresh start.

JESSE: (smiling back) Yeah, I like it.

They step out of the car and walk up to the house. Gustavo rings the doorbell, and an elderly woman answers.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Hello, how can I help you?

GUSTAVO: We're interested in renting this house. Is it still available?

ELDERLY WOMAN: Yes, it is. Come on in, I'll show you around.

She shows them around the house, and they both nod in approval.

ELDERLY WOMAN: So, when would you like to move in?

GUSTAVO: (looking at Jesse) Today, if that's okay with you.

ELDERLY WOMAN: (smiling) That's fine. I'll just need some information from you both.

Gustavo and Jesse fill out the necessary paperwork, and the elderly woman hands them the keys.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Welcome to our town. I hope you enjoy your stay.

Gustavo and Jesse smile and thank her before walking out of the house. They walk back to the car and get in.

JESSE: (smiling) I can't believe it. We actually did it.

GUSTAVO: (smiling back) We did. And now, it's time to make the most of it.

They drive off into the town, exploring their new home.

CUT TO:

INT. A SMALL CAF√â - DAY

Gustavo and Jesse are sitting in a small caf√©, sipping coffee and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) This is nice. I could get used to this.

JESSE: (nodding) Yeah, me too.

Suddenly, a group of men enter the caf√©, dressed in black and armed with guns.

LEADER: (pointing at Gustavo) You. You're coming with us.

Gustavo and Jesse look at each other, fear in their eyes.

GUSTAVO: (whispering) Stay calm, Jesse.

They get up and follow the men out of the caf√© and into a waiting van.

CUT TO:

INT. A LARGE WAREHOUSE - DAY

Gustavo and Jesse are tied up and sitting on the ground in the middle of a large warehouse. The same group of men from the caf√© are standing around them, guns pointed at their heads.

LEADER: (smiling) Well, well, well. Look who we have here. The great Gustavo Fring.

GUSTAVO: (calmly) What do you want from me?

LEADER: (laughing) What do we want? We want your money, Gustavo. And we want revenge.

GUSTAVO: (confused) Revenge? What are you talking about?

LEADER: (angrily) You killed our boss, that's what. And now, it's payback time.

Gustavo and Jesse exchange a worried look.

GUSTAVO: (whispering to Jesse) We have to get out of here, Jesse. We can't let them get the upper hand.

JESSE: (nodding) Okay, but how?

GUSTAVO: (looking around) We need a distraction. Something to give us a chance to escape.

JESSE: (looking around) Like what?

Gustavo scans the warehouse for something he can use to create a distraction. His eyes land on a large stack of gasoline canisters in the corner.

GUSTAVO: (whispering) The gas canisters. I have an idea.

JESSE: (confused) What idea?

GUSTAVO: (whispering) We need to create a diversion. I'm going to light those gas canisters on fire. When everyone's attention is focused on the fire, we make a run for it.

JESSE: (nervously) What if we don't make it out?

GUSTAVO: (firmly) We have to try. It's our only chance.

Jesse nods, his face set in determination. Gustavo takes a deep breath and begins to work on freeing himself from his bonds.

As he struggles, the leader of the group approaches him with a gun.

LEADER: (smirking) You're not going anywhere, Gustavo.

Gustavo looks up at him, his eyes cold and calculating.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Oh, I think I am.

In one swift motion, Gustavo frees himself from his bonds and knocks the leader's gun out of his hand. He then grabs a lighter from his pocket and runs towards the gas canisters.

Jesse follows close behind, dodging bullets as they run.

Gustavo reaches the canisters and sets them ablaze. The flames quickly spread, creating a wall of fire between them and their attackers.

GUSTAVO: (shouting) Now, Jesse! Run!

They sprint towards the exit, their hearts pounding with fear and adrenaline. The sounds of gunfire and explosions echo behind them as they make their escape.

Finally, they burst through the doors of the warehouse and into the sunlight. They collapse on the ground, gasping for breath.

JESSE: (panting) We did it.

GUSTAVO: (smiling) Yes, we did.

They sit there for a moment, catching their breath and basking in the relief of their escape.

GUSTAVO: (standing up) But we can't stay here. We have to keep moving.

JESSE: (nodding) Right. What do we do now?

GUSTAVO: (firmly) We keep running. We can't stop until we're safe.

Jesse nods, and they get back in the car and drive away, leaving the town and their would-be captors behind.

FADE OUT.

A lot of people interpret this as Jesse choosing not to be a killer but I think it is more a realization of Walt's intention. Walt obviously wanted to die there because the alternative was being arrested or dying from cancer all alone. My takeaway from that scene is that Walt wanted Jesse to get closure. Jesse hated Walt and obviously wanted him dead. Walt knew this and thought Jesse finally seeing him dead would help him, which is why he lies and says he needed Jesse to kill him when in fact he didn't. 

The truth is Walt had already been dealt a fatal wound. He was going to die regardless. He didn't need Jesse at all and when Jesse realizes this he refuses to do it.  Walt didn't want Jesse to shoot him because he needed someone to kill him, he wanted it because he thought it would help Jesse to feel better. It wasn't another selfish request he'd made to Jesse, it was his final selfless act. That's at least how I interpreted it.",Jesse's final choice

He breaks into Jack Welker's hideout, where his former partners are holding Jesse Pinkman hostage. Walt uses his enhanced senses to track down Jack and his men, slicing through them with ease. Jesse, who has been beaten and broken, looks on in shock as Walt appears before him.

Walt sets Jesse free, and together they take out the remaining members of Jack's gang. They then find Lydia at a coffee shop and take her out as well. But Walt is not done yet.

He uses his heightened senses to track down Todd, who has taken Andrea's life. Walt confronts Todd, and in a brutal fight, he unleashes his claws and pierces Todd's skin, inflicting mortal wounds. As Todd lies dying, Walt finally frees Jesse from the grip of his addiction by telling him to leave and start a new life.

In the end, Walter White, now truly a force to be reckoned with, wanders off into the desert, his future uncertain. As he stands alone in the vast expanse, he realizes that despite his newfound power, he cannot outrun his fate. He falls to his knees, his claws retracting as he takes his last breath, the cancer finally claiming him.

As dark as this may be, I think it would have nailed home the point to Walt that he ruined everything, and that he doesn‚Äôt end up winning, and it was all for nothing.


Because in my opinion Walt still ‚Äúwins‚Äù. He had the time of his life being the worlds biggest kingpin next to Gus, he kills all the bad guys at the end, he sets his partner free, and he succeeds at doing his main objective: make a boatload of money to secure his family and their future.

Hank and Gomey‚Äôs deaths were a huge blow, but Andrea‚Äôs was the most fucked up. 

Walt really went god mode these last 2 seasons.

Even though he's just following Walt's recipe, he eventually rivals Walt in skill.

326,breakingbad,"Just to be clear, I'm NOT saying the below is in any way a problem with the show, much the opposite, I'm saying it's just struck me how the destructive aspect of seeking purity seems like a central theme of the show.

Walt is obsessed over the purity and quality of his product, and this is central to his identity, and it's a great plot device, and arguably in part takes him to his doom.

Virtually every meth-slinger he deals with also seems to buy into and feed into this obsession with purity even long after it's become obvious that Walt burns his business partners again and again and causes their deaths. I'm not sure whether this would happen in real life but it really doesn't matter, this is a story.

It is interesting that almost no one ever argues that the purity of the meth is not important. There's Jesse Pinkman in S3 E10 telling Walt, ""Look, I like making cherry product, but let's keep it real, alright? We make poison for people who don't care. We probably have the most unpicky customers in the world."" But that's about it.

By contrast I do think of The Wire and what Stringer Bell says about slinging a different highly addictive and destructive substance ""...shit is weak all over. The thing is, no matter what we call heroin, it's gonna get sold. Shit is strong, we gonna sell it; shit is weak, we gonna sell twice as much. You know why? 'Cause a fiend, he gonna chase that shit no matter what. It's crazy, you know. We do worse, and we get paid more.""

I'm not saying that there aren't economic reasons for meth-slingers to want Walt's better product, but there are always pros and cons and Walt was such a destructive force, even more than the dynamics of that destructive blackmarket industry as presented generally on the show, so it is interesting that even as the evidence of that piles up time and time again the meth slingers keep choosing to do business with Walt for his product of greater purity, to their own destruction.

Hell Walt even ethnically cleanses non-whites from the ABQ underworld and then does business with neo-nazis obsessed with their vision of ""racial purity"" who in the end also get destroyed due to their connection to him and his ""pure"" product!",The destruction of seeking purity seems like central theme

335,breakingbad,"Mr. White was a beloved high school chemistry teacher who had dedicated his life to teaching and helping his students succeed. However, his life took a drastic turn when he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, leaving him with only a few months to live.

As a result, Mr. White was faced with the daunting task of figuring out how to provide for his family after he was gone. His meager teacher's salary would not be enough to support them, and he knew that he needed to find a way to make some quick cash.

With his extensive knowledge of chemistry, Mr. White began to cook crystals - a highly addictive and dangerous drug - in the hopes of selling it for a profit. At first, he was hesitant to break the law, but his desperate need for money outweighed his moral compass.

Things were going smoothly for a while, and Mr. White was able to make enough money to provide for his family. However, his luck soon ran out when he found himself in trouble with an evil gang who were also involved in the drug trade.

The gang demanded that Mr. White work for them, using his chemistry skills to cook more drugs and increase their profits. Terrified for his life and the safety of his family, Mr. White reluctantly agreed to work for them.

As the weeks passed, Mr. White's situation became increasingly dire. He was forced to work long hours and endure constant threats from the gang members, who were always watching him. He became consumed by fear and paranoia, and the guilt of what he was doing weighed heavily on his conscience.

Despite the danger, Mr. White refused to give up. He was determined to provide for his family, no matter the cost. However, his actions eventually caught up with him, and he found himself in a dangerous showdown with the gang.

In the end, Mr. White was able to outsmart his enemies and come out on top. He was able to secure a safe future for his family, but at a great cost. He had sacrificed his own morality and integrity in the process, and he knew that he would carry the weight of his actions with him for the rest of his life.

As Mr. White lay dying in a hospital bed, he reflected on his life and the choices he had made. He realized that, in the end, it was not the money or the power that mattered, but the love and connections he had forged with the people he cared about. He hoped that, despite his mistakes, his family would remember him for the kind and caring teacher he had always been, rather than the criminal he had become",I asked chatgpt to write a story about about a teacher named mr white who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has to cook crystals to make money for his family. while doing so he gets into trouble involving an evil gang

Again, when things were looking smooth with Walter controlling the operations and everything, Jesse decided to destroy it all by turning into a maniac over the controlled poisoning Walt had done on Brock.

396,breakingbad,"I just finished up the series, and it was certainly a great watch. I unfortunately spoiled it for myself before hand, so I sort of knew was what coming.

I had perused a bunch of Reddit threads &amp; other discussion boards. There was seemingly a lot of agreement with Mike when he went off on Walter shortly before his death, regarding his ego &amp; pride.

Outside of season 5, I really didn‚Äôt see most of Walt‚Äôs actions that way. I actually hard disagree with Mike. Hot take coming in, but Mike dying in the middle of nowhere, broke &amp; alone was too good a death for him.

Anyways, as far as walt himself, most of his actions were fairly sound, to me at least, most of the first few seasons.

Season 1 he was forced into killing Krazy 8 &amp; the other guy for obvious reasons. He was in way over his head. Tuco was another fan of worms entirely. Jesse warned him about it, but he was blinded by the $. 

Season 2 Jesse warned him again about expanding the territory, but Walt didn‚Äôt listen. Definitely some ego there. I see alot of people say he let Jane die to manipulate Jesse, but i really saw it as saving Jesse more than anything else. Walt definitely truly cared for Jesse. 

Which bring us to season 3 &amp; mike‚Äôs point‚Ä¶ Walt was happy cooking for Gus. He even told Jesse he was being greedy when Jesse questioned them getting paid only $3M when they were cooking $96M worth of meth. (The 3 month contract I believe) Walt wasn‚Äôt trying to usurp Gus. He even called Gus to set Jesse straight as a final Hail Mary. Walt deferred to Jesse and Mike that entire season. Mike was the one recommending no half measures and to essentially take Jesse to pasture because of his issues. 

Once Walt saw the news about the kid being killed, he rushed to save Jesse from himself. Walt put himself at great personal risk for Jesse. Killing game was simply self preservation.

Season 4 was Walt t starting to go o a bit crazy, but I believe he was right. Gus would‚Äôve eventually offed him. Gus &amp; Mike were trying to manipulate Jesse against Walt, and replace Walt with Jesse once they realized he could cook.

Honesty, mikes entire rant seemed like self righteous garbage. Walt WAS an egomaniac by then, but I think he would‚Äôve happily worked for Gus had Jesse not gone rogue. The fact that Mike acts like walter killed Gus for funsies isnt accurate. Gus was planning to move against Hank, and Walt escalated  to protect hank &amp; his family. Poisoning Brock was a new low for sure though.

414,breakingbad,"The ending of season 4 made for some fantastic television. ""6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6."" But from a strictly in-universe perspective, could Walter have handled it another way? Obviously once Mike was about to kill him he was backed into a corner and had to act immediately, but there was a brief time period before that where he had the chance to take a different approach.

Here's my reasoning: Walter didn't actually need Gale permanently gone. He knew that even with Gale out of the picture, Gus would still be looking for an opportunity to get rid of him. After Gale's exit, the ""face off"" between Walter and Gus was completely inevitable: Gus ""had to go"". All Walter really needed was for Gale to be out of the picture for *long enough for him to kill Gus*. 

So what if he had Saul help him arrange the kidnapping of Gale, and had Gale imprisoned in a remote location indefinitely, until he was able to resolve the Gus situation, whereupon Gale could be freed? Would this have worked? What do you think?

Obviously what actually happened was way better from a storytelling perspective; like I said, this is all strictly in-universe reasoning.",Could the event at the end of S4 have been avoided?

I personally think a Gus origin story would be interesting, but I know that Vince Gilligan doesn‚Äôt want the Breaking Bad universe to overstay its welcome and go on too long, so I feel that a movie would be a better choice rather than a multi season show.

The title is The Life and Times of Gustavo Fring. And the opening scene is his iconic death scene. I imagine there‚Äôs plenty of archived footage of that scene shot at different angles. So, we start off with a shot of just outside the hospital room. We hear the bell ringing, and the room explodes. Then of course, Gus walks out, straightens his tie, and we pan over to his demolished face, he falls over. We zoom in on his face, slowly, and a voice over of Gus says something along the lines of ‚ÄúAs I lie here, I think of everything that has lead me here. My life flashes before my eyes, my rise to power, the sacrifices I made‚Ä¶but it was not always that way‚Ä¶‚Äù (hopefully written better than that lol), and then the flashbacks start.

While I cannot name a better show off the top of my head, I don‚Äôt think I can say that it is the best show of all time. In my opinion season 4 or 5 could easily be argued as the best seasons of a show of all time but BB altogether has its fair share of flaws.

The most prominent flaw in my opinion is what the majority of the younger viewers take from the show. Myself included, I thought Walt was a badass who wasn‚Äôt appreciated enough by others. Looking back, he had decent intentions going into the meth business but he lost himself in the process and became an evil man.(The character development of Walt is truly a masterpiece)

I think this is so dumb. It made me hate Jesse...like wow, what a loser, way to drop the ball at the most important moment. His motivations don't even add up, it just feels like a way to make the show go longer.

489,breakingbad,"I haven't watched Better Call Saul, so I am going only by Breaking Bad. If BCS has more info, then I do not mind getting my mind changed.

Everyone loves Mike. And he said that Walt ruined a good thing. How?

1. Gus refuses to work with Walt because of Jesse. He goes so far as wanting to kill Jesse and people seem to forget that Mike has absolutely no fucking problem doing it. He even tells Walt on a couple of occasions that Jesse needs to go. 

2. After selling the 40 pounds of Walt's meth, Gus finally understands what Gale meant by the difference between his and Walt's product. He then tries repeatedly to hire Walt, who wants out. He then plays to Walt's ego and pits him and Jesse against each other to make sure thay Walt agrees. Something he succeeds.

3. After getting beaten up by Hank, Jesse threatens Walt, saying he will cook by himself and if it ever happens that he gets caught, he will give the cops Walt on a silver platter. So Walt needs to get Jesse to work with him. Something he manages to do. If Gus finds out, Jesse is dead. 

4. They start cooking. Everything is going well. Then Jesse finds out about Combo. Now here's the thing: Gus 100% knew that his crew was using kids. They had his blessing for it. I am sure of that. Gus is too much of a control freak and perfectionist and professional businessman not to know. He is not over using kids. He is also not over killing kids as he threatens Holly. So Gus knew they were using kids, he knew they used the kid to kill Combo, and I am sure he ordered the death of Tomas. So that means that the whole meeting with Jesse and the two henchmen was just a facade. He had no interest in keeping the peace. He just wanted to protect his own interests. 

5. Walt protects Jesse and kills the two henchmen. Jesse runs. Immediately after, Gus is pissed and wants to kill Jesse. He lies to Walt when he says its fine and he can cook with Gale, but in reality, he wants Gale to take over immediately and he wants to kill Walt. Walt manages to understand and anticipate that. And just in time. Walt has done nothing wrong other than defend himself and his partner. So Jesse kills Gale. 

From this point onwards, Gus will try to kill Walt and replace him at the earliest. Walt knows this, and Jesse know this. So Walt needs to kill Gus before he dies.

The romanian car wash owner guy. If your boss was like him, how would you deal with it? He pushes walt, a middle age dude with cancer (though this he may not know) to work extra for chump change. It becomes clear during Walts buyout of the carwash that he did get a kick out of the power he held over walt as he was taunting walt the entire time, reminding him that he's beneath.

549,breakingbad,"The first time I watched Breaking Bad I was probably 16 years old. Now I'm rewatching it after 10 years and I view his character very differently.

I remember I used to feel a lot more sympathy towards him, and I too would get annoyed at characters like Skyler, but this time it's the other way round. Skyker is just a good wife and mother who is worried and trying to look out for her family, while Walter disappears for hours on end without, even missing his daughter's birth. I feel awful for Jesse who is just a guy who took the wrong path in life but is a good and loving person, and you just wish he could escape that life. I feel bad for Hank who is like that tough uncle who deep down has a soft good caring heart. I feel bad for Walter Jr who doesn't show it that much but worries greatly about his dad and the cancer. And so on.

And meanwhile Walter just keeps growing more rotten, evil and greedy. Of course, the show is called ""Breaking Bad"" for a reason, and his character development is incredible. Skyler's character is also standing in the ""hero's"" way so it's normal to dislike her. All characters are magnificently crafted to meet their purpose in the show.

Maybe being a teenager Walter seemed so much cooler, but it's funny now that I'm a bit older that he's probably the guy I like the least - despite loving his character somehow.","Watching the show after 10 years, I now feel a lot less sympathy towards Walter"
550,breakingbad,"In the early episodes, they show us that Walt's meth's purity in 99.1 while he was cooking in the RV and it's still the same in ""Say My Name"". I just can't help but wonder how different the conditions under which the meth was cooked. Cooking in an RV with high school equipment with minimum gear gave out the same quality meth vs cooked in a very sophisticated lab meant for cooking meth with the best of the best equipment. How did they add up to the same quality? It would've made sense if the meth cooked in the RV was around 95% due to the conditions and lack of good equipment and over 99% in Gus's lab.",Why was Walt's meth purity the same while cooking in the RV and in Gus's lab?

559,breakingbad,"Skyler wanted him to leave the house, after learning he was a meth distributor, but he refused and stayed. So when she locked him out of the bathroom he pissed in their kitchen sink. Under normal circumstances I'd say Skyler was wrong for locking him out of the bathroom. But given the circumstances, she was in the right. Walt could have easily chosen to piss in the backyard, but instead he did it in the kitchen sink.

I mean, who does he think he is? Look at that statue! All alone in the desert, with no one to even thank you. And what's with that pedestal, those words so grand? ""My name is Ozymandias, look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""

Despair? I mean, who talks like that? Was he trying to impress someone? It's like he's overcompensating for something, you know what I mean? And what's with those legs of stone, just standing there? It's like they're waiting for something, but what? A pair?

And now, all that's left is sand, stretching far and wide, No trace of his kingdom, his power or his pride. So what have we learned from Ozymandias' tale? That in the end, all empires and egos will fail.

I mean, let's face it, we're all just temporary, Here today, gone tomorrow, it's kind of scary. But maybe that's okay, we don't need a statue or a throne, Just some good friends and a place to call our own.""",Ozymandias poem in the style of Jerry Seinfeld according to AI overlords

Personally I feel Jesse's situation was his parents' fault. They were so scared of the younger brother turning out like Jesse that they essentially disowned him and kicked him out of the house when he needed them the most, leaving him bait to Walt's antics and manipulation.

The plot itself is not bad, but as the series goes on it becomes so convoluted that I felt that I was not as invested anymore.  The final nail in that coffin was Gus‚Äôs death, which I can‚Äôt complain about, it had to happen, but that should have been the end of the show.  It didn‚Äôt need an entire season for filler and a few plot points shoved into a few episodes.


The characters are completely awful.  I don‚Äôt think there are any characters I genuinely like besides Junior and Hank.  


Walter is a horrible human being who deserves what he got.  He had good intentions in season 1/2 but as the show went on his family was just an excuse for his business yet when there were consequences for his actions he cried or begged for mercy (in any other situation he would be killed but he‚Äôs the main character so he had plot armor)


Skylar is probably the worst or maybe the second worst character on the show.  At first I can sympathize with her due to the fact that she was lied to so many times by Walt, but over time she became just as complicit.  She cheated on him and she thought that made anything better.  


Jesse was such a laughably bad character.  I get he‚Äôs supposed to have a tragic character arc but all he does is go from a happy junkie to someone who whines about the decisions they‚Äôve made.  He acts as if it‚Äôs anyone else‚Äôs fault but his for the situation he‚Äôs in and he makes sure the audience knows it.


Walter Jr is the only pure character on the show, who doesn‚Äôt deserve the life he‚Äôs given.  He barely gets any attention from his parents and on top of that they sell drugs for a living.


Holly is the same as Walter Jr.  


Hank is the best character and the only morally conscious one at that.  He actually cares for people enough to do something about the meth problem going on in Albuquerque.  


Marie has a few bad moments but overall is a loving sister in law and still cared for Skyler even when she knew about the meth.  

At the end of the day, the show isn‚Äôt anything special that sticks with me, and I can‚Äôt see why someone would find it as such.  The show had such a good start but by the end it fell off.",This show is not that good

687,breakingbad,"Breaking Bad is an American drama tv-series created by Vince Gilligan that originally aired on AMC from 2008 to 2013 spanning over 6 seasons and tons of hour-long episodes and nowadays, the entire series is available to be watched on Netflix. I have been meaning to watch the entire series after the countless amounts of memes I have seen the Breaking Bad community has created and after binge watching it for the last 2 weeks, I have decided to write a short spoiler free review about the entire series in a general sense.

Before talking about the best parts about the series in my opinion, Breaking Bad is known for its cinematography and how it uses lighting, colours, framing, and setting the right music at the right time to make the scenes be more memorable to the viewers and after watching it, I agree that show utilises these aspects in a way that makes it stand out from other shows. Due to Breaking Bad, I have also learned that when someone walks or gets into Mexico, their entire world becomes yellow.

The story revolves around Walter White, an honest high school chemistry teacher who after being diagnosed with cancer, begins to delve into the crime world and start cooking and selling meth to make money before he dies so that his family will be well off when he does. He partners up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his, after catching him running away from a meth lab. While Walter and Jesse are doing their schemes, Skyler White who is Walter‚Äôs wife, is oblivious to any of it and tries her hardest to help Walter after learning about his cancer. She is also pregnant at the start of the series. AS the episodes progress, Walter has to learn how to balance his life of crime and his honest life as to not draw any attention to him. This task is a bit more difficult than you might think because his brother-in-law, Hank (ASAC) Schrader is a DEA agent whose entire job is to catch drug dealers. 

Now the best part of the entire series in my opinion is the characters themselves. Due to the show‚Äôs excellent writing, the characters all have their own unique traits and quirks that sometimes leads to disputes with each other. For example, although Walter and Jesse are partners, they tend to disagree with the way they want to run the operations. Skyler White, while is usually not very well liked by the community, is still written in a way that perfectly describes her as either being a detriment to Walter or genuinely her doings things that she feels is the right thing to do for her family. There are also the various drug lords Walter meets throughout the series. Without major spoilers, they each have their own reason for Walter and Jesse to be terrified of but Walter is a man with great ambition and too little time to achieve and will do anything to get what he wants.

In any case, Breaking Bad is a 10/10 show and I highly recommends it to anyone thinking of watching it.",A Spoiler-Free (Mostly) Review of Breaking Bad for a school project
688,breakingbad," I watched Breaking Bad and Gravity Falls. and i wondered  that there is unique parallel between Bill cipher's death and Gus fring's death.  
 Stanford made a deal with his brother Stanley, to switch dress to fool Bill Cipher to possess Stanford (who is Stanley actually.) Walter White made a deal with Hector Salamanca to assassinate Gus Fring by installing and hiding the pipe bomb in hector's wheelchair. 

Bill Cipher tries to completely possess Stanford (Stanley, actually), Gus Fring tries to kill Hector Salamanca by injecting the poison in Hector's vein.

 Stanley reveals to Bill that he possessed the wrong person and tells Stanford to mind erase Stanley's mind, Stanley himself did one punch on Bill Cipher and dies, Stanley got his mind erased, but his mind got back correctly. on the parallel, before Gus Fring tries to inject the poison in Hector Salamanca's vein, Hector looks at Gus in the face finally, before he rings multiple times, and Gus Fring, Tyrus Kitt, and Hector himself die in fiery explosion. There is the suicidal parallel between two situation.  


 What blows my mind actually, is both deaths is motivated by family.

 The last thing Stanley said to Bill Cipher is that Bill is smart, but he made one mistake, he messed with Stanley's family. He almost killed all pines' family prior to his death. The last look Hector gave to Gus, sadness and regret then pure fury and rage look, its as if Hector saying to Gus (in my interpretation), ""you are the smartest person I have ever known, I shouldn't underestimated you, but you made one mistake, you messed and destroyed my family"". Which makes sense, Gus by his manipulation and cunning intelligence, killed the cousins (killed by two different persons, but Gus is connected to it), and Lalo Salamanca (Directly), Joaqin Salamanca (Jesse actually killed Joaqin when Gus is poisoned in ""Salud"")  prior to his death. The only member he didn't kill is Tuco (who is killed by Hank Schrader, and Gus wasn't even a thing prior to Mandala episode).",there is odd parallel between Gravity Falls's Bill Cipher and Gus Fring in breaking bad.

697,breakingbad,"Reasons

1. Films that wrestled with similar themes and notions only last 2 hours to 3 hours. Breaking Bad allows its' concepts to simmer over the course of 46 hours wher ethe viewer can contemplate the themes and dynamics of power. 
2. No other movie that is great hs gained a following that is so obsessive about the story and themes. I have ten movies I love, but I can stop talking about them and thinking about them after they end. With Breaking Bad, you cannot stop thinking about it and talking about it for years, which is true testimony to its power and affect on people. 
3. The epic journey of Walter White is realistic. It feels real even though everyone knows it's fiction. Inasmuch, it defies the viewers' doubts and absorbs them into a fictional world that they know is fiction but cannot deny feels asbolutely real. 
4. Every great film is forgettable, but with Breaking Bad you just cannot stop talking about it. No other movie has ever reached this level of addictiveness. As great as my favorite movies are and I love them, they don't occupy your thoughts and soul for so many weeks and years after they end. You just say it's a good movie, but with Breaking Bad, you have to go into detail and analyze every last detail. 
5. The writing, storytelling, and cinematography combine to create an addictive and unforgettable experience that makes you compare everything else you see and have seen to its' brilliance.",Unpopular Opinion: Breaking Bad is the Greatest Work of Film Art in the Last Four Decades

This was some of the finest cinematography I have experienced, especially the climactic episodes of season 4. I particularly loved the ending of Crawl Space - a perfect emulation of fear and extreme stress.

Am I completely wrong about this? Jesse isn't Ted Beneke purposefully defrauding shit within a business or whatnot. Could Jesse have been right in assuming Saul was making it sound worse than it is? We all know Saul wants his 17%.

766,breakingbad,"Which begs the question  why the fuck do I see this part of the 5th season get hate ? I throughly enjoyed it more than most seasons ,Season 1 was then season I felt was the more consistent sure it lacked an ending but that was because of the writer‚Äôs strike in 08/09 and the following 2 episodes were awesome and Grilled is easily one of the best episodes in the series,I felt 2 and 3 were really good too but I honestly like 1 more (although I really like Jesse in the series later more) 

Also Fly is a good episode and is no where near the worst episode in the series (good metaphor for Walt‚Äôs life)

Honestly I knew the acting was superb in the series but I was still surprised Brayan Cranston‚Äôs performances during the series are honestly so good words cannot describe them and as a person that watched Malcom in the Middle,it contextualizes how good he is here in the series,Arron Paul also is amazing in many instances and not in just one scene or too examples are Peekaboo,One Minute,Full Measures and many many others ,Jesse has a very interesting character arc during the series too

I liked Mike and Hank really surprised me (thought he was a character I would dislike in the begging but was proven wrong an episode later) 

Gus is a great villain but I honestly don‚Äôt care that much about him (and I don‚Äôt know why,I just like certain villains more or to put it more precisely antagonists)

Saul is also great but I think that one‚Äôs a given 


Also there are many great acting performances in the series,Skylar ,Marrie ,Hank,Tuco,Tio are all very well acted,Vince is an incredible director and show runner and every episode HE ACTUALLY DIRECTED to me was a 10/10


Besides me thinking S5A is overhated ,I honestly predicted that this might be the case but Skylar Is INSANELY OVER-HATED to degrees beyond belief,I mean Face Off kind proves her point about Walt

My Favorite episodes are as follows by order of appearance (season)

S1 E1: Pilot, S1 E3: ...And the Bag's in the River

S2 E2: Grilled, S2 E6: Peekaboo, S2 E9: 4 Days Out

S3 E7: One Minute, S3 E12: Half Measures, S3 E13: Full Measure

S4 E11: Crawl Space, S4 E12: End Times, S4 E13: Face Off

If we count S5 these are my favorites up to now

S5 E5: Dead Fright, S5 E7: Say My Name and I guess maybe S5 E8: Gliding Over All (Another Supremely well done cliffhanger)",I just finished Season 5A and it‚Äôs actually really GOOD

Remember your lines."" This was making it even harder for him, as it added to the pressure, so much so he had to take a break and talk to the director. The director said, ""Two things, Larry: First, all actors go up on their lines, it happens. The second thing is, we're losing the light, so fuck Bryan and let's just finish this scene."" Larry got it right after that. Kinda disappointing hearing about this, as Bryan always seems so professional and kind, but I get it, there was probably a lot of pressure going around.",Did you know

When Jesse first turned up, he got Jesse to snort some meth before he did. I guess to check it was legit or he wasn't a cop. What if he did the same with the risen?

This wasn't Walt trying to manipulate Jesse, this was just him wanting to cook with him. Ever heard of someone wanting to share something they enjoy with their friend before?

It's odd to me that Walt was ok with letting a loose end like this be out there. Walt even tries to convince himself after he killed Mike that it had to be done, which is referring to the loose end angel, but the scene itself shows us it was a heat of the moment decision that Walt initially felt bad about.",Question about Walt and Mike

840,breakingbad,"Hello everyone,

you will probably know that in 2014, circa a year after Breaking Bad's finale aired, they released a Columbian remake named ""Met√†stasis"". The show's script was the exact same as the original, but the actors, directors and locations were different. It followed Walter Blanco and Jos√© Miguel Rosas (this show's version of Walt and Jesse) having to cook and sell meth.

The show got... mixed reviews (it currently has 2.6/10 on IMDb), and it pretty much shown how a Breaking Bad remake was not needed.

However, as humans we never learn from our past mistakes, so GET READY, because roughly a week ago the *second* Breaking Bad remake was announced!

It will be produced in South-Korea and it will be four seasons long K-Drama (Korean Drama).

The premise is not the best, and there's a pretty high chance that this show will turn out to be *Met√†stasis 2*, but... what if it was actually good? I don't think it will, but it doesn't seem like it will be a ""the same but worse"" kind of remake, it will be something different... but not necessairly good.

So, what do you think? Do you think it will be a masterpiece that is going to top the original?

Thank you for everything.","The ""Breaking Bad"" remake nobody wanted"

864,breakingbad,,Hey everyone. I made this tribute to Walter White. Watch it and see if you like it and tell me your opinion. Thanks :)
865,breakingbad,"First, throughout the show I wanted to post here but I was afraid I was going to see spoilers (but I already had from TikTok). Throughout all the Seasons, I did have some questions that I wanted to ask you guys. 

First of all - Do you guys think Hank could have lived? I mean, if I was Walter I wouldn't have said ""Don't come Jack"", because If I was Jack and my client said that and hung up, you bet im going over there, its just not trustworthy to stay home. If I was Walter I would have fired my gun, said ""I got Jesse. Do not come."" I would then hang up and turn myself in. I know Walter didn't want to go to Jail but, hey I think it would have been better. 

Second of all, on the first Episode (or 2nd, I can't remember), when Walter wanted to cook with Jesse, he said ""We cook or I turn you in."" Now, Jesse should have noticed here that there is **NO** reason for Walt to turn him in, Walt simply said that to scare him. 

Third of all, every day I think about what would have happened if Hank didn't take a shit that day, their lives would have ran so smoothly. 

Fourth of all, when Walter finds out his cancer is gone, he punches the dryer until his prints of his fists are there. Was this because he thought ""I did all of this for nothing, my cancer is gone?""

Fifth of all, how did Walter die? The machine gun that shot through the house had NO chance of hitting Walter, I don't think Jesse shot him when he was under him, that would be pointless. 

Sixth of all, the ""He will make you dissapear"" service isn't that good. He just makes you a couple of fake IDS, and re-locates you, unless you were a ""hot"" client like Walter, if you just got re-located as a normal guy, you probably could have done it yourself. Leave everything behind, make a fake ID, and drive to a different state. I feel like Saul kind of exaggerated how good of a service it was (it was a good service, just not as good as he was talking about). 

Seventh of all, why does Walt JR. think Walter killed Hank? Did Skyler not tell him? Walter did say that he was going to kill the guys who killed Hank, so maybe Skyler told Walt. JR off camera?

Finally, a stupid question to finish it off, but did Lydia like Todd back?",Just Finished Breaking Bad - Spoilers!

869,breakingbad,"""I know good criminals, and bad cops."" 

The thing is, that Mike was a bad cop (moraly speaking), and then he went to become an even worse criminal. He's not a good guy in any way shape or form, he's a cold blooded killer. Even tho he only killed people ""in the game"" he has been an accessory in countless civilian deaths, even children. 

I understand people sympathizing with his seemingly honorable goal of providing for his family, like Walt. The thing is, where most understood that Walt's goals shifted from selfless to selfish, they don't realize that Mike followed the exact same road, he had already saved so much money for his granddaughter, but stayed in the game anyway, because HE LIKED IT, HE WAS GOOD A IT. 

I heard so many thing about his death, how he didn't deserve to die, how Walt is an asshole and killed him out of pure ego because mike did his little killer speech et c. 

This is just not true, for all of the above, mike deserved death penalty hands down. 

Walt's ego certainly played a role in his demise, but Walt's actions were not asinine, and he already got the gun before the argument. Mike was a loose end. Mike could/would have come back to get revenge for his guys.

Most importantly, Mike and Walt were anything but friends, those are 2 hardened criminals, who have been at each others throat since day one. Mike insulted him, beat him up, and was ready to kill him several time. It is safe to say that both man hated each other, especialy Mike since Walt killed Gus. People here make it seem like Walt shot his buddy after losing a smah bross game. 

""If you had just shut your mouth, known your place, everything would have been fine."" (ie let Jesse die) 

If Mike HAD JUST SHUT HIS MOUTH, KNOWN HIS PLACE, EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE. Litteraly. When Walt said ""you're welcome"" he could have just walked away but no, he just had to go and lambast Walt one last time. And that was the last nail in his acid barrel. If this wasn't ironic enough, his granddaughter will never get the money. 

It's not only Walt's ego that killed Mike, but Mike's own ego. Change my mind.",[Unpopular opinion] Mike had it coming.

878,breakingbad,"so‚Ä¶.i finally finished the show and it‚Äôs pretty good. i had a lot of fun, especially in the earlier, better seasons and i‚Äôd pretty comfortably say that this show is overall really good. but i didn‚Äôt love Ozymandias.

for years, i‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs one of the best episodes of television, so my hype was pretty strong going into it. i waited for the moment, scene or line that would elevate this iconic episode from being just another episode in a good show to being the unbridled masterpiece that everyone says it is. and i waited. and i waited.

turns out, it‚Äôs one of the worst episodes of the show, which means it‚Äôs still a good episode of television, don‚Äôt get me wrong. but given how good some of the episodes of this show are, and how highly acclaimed this episode in particular is, i was left extremely disappointed.

in my mind, i was comparing this episode to ‚ÄòThe View From Halfway Down‚Äô in Bojack Horseman or ‚ÄòGganbu‚Äô in Squid Game, two episodes of television that unquestionably earn that elusive 10/10 from me. the difference in quality is staggering.

the cinematography is neat and the acting is as good as it‚Äôs ever been but the writing for the episode is very predictable and bland. if basically anything else had happened, that would‚Äôve been more interesting to me.

if you disagree with me, by all means please tell me why. i am more than happy to conversate over it. maybe i‚Äôm missing something BIG, i‚Äôve only seen the show once and haven‚Äôt had a ton of time to think about it, only a few weeks.",i did not care for Ozymandias

Skylar confronts him about how he got away and accused him of killing Hank, and Walter admits that Hank was dead, even though he tried to save him. All of that was true, but there is literally no way for Skylar or Jr. to know this. 

Jr. didn't understand who Walter was, but Skylar did. That's why she defended them from Walter. Everything points to Walter killing Hank. Even if Jr. didn't know how dangerous he was, Walter proved it by kidnapping Holly. Everything was proven true and that Jr. made the right choice.

The world around him begins to blur and distort, and he struggles to focus on his students. As he drones on about chemistry, one of his students raises his hand and asks a question.

""Mr. White, will this be on the midterm?""

Walter blinks and shakes his head, trying to clear his vision. But when he opens his eyes again, the student's question has changed.

""Mr. White, will this be on the murder?""

Walter freezes, his heart pounding in his chest. He tries to tell himself that it's just a hallucination, a side effect of the chemotherapy. But the look on the student's face tells him otherwise. There's something in the way the student is looking at him, something that makes Walter's skin crawl.

Walter stammers, trying to find the words to respond, but the student interrupts him.

""I know what you did, Mr. White,"" the student says quietly. ""I know what happened to that man in the desert.""

Walter's mind races. How could this student know? Did he slip up somewhere, leave a clue behind?

But before he can say anything else, the student continues.

""I'm not going to turn you in, Mr. White,"" the student says. ""I don't want to get involved. But I need to know that you're not going to hurt anyone else.""

Walter stares at the student, his mind whirring with possibilities. He could deny everything, claim that the student is crazy. He could try to scare the student into keeping quiet. Or he could take a chance and confide in him, hope that the student will keep his secret.

In the end, Walter takes a deep breath and leans in close to the student.

""You have no idea what I'm capable of,"" he whispers. ""But I promise you, I won't hurt anyone else. Not if you keep your mouth shut.""

917,breakingbad,"Spoilers:  


We all know Walt dies at the end of S5 and we know that Jesse was found out and escaped to Alaska in El Camino. But what would have happened had all the key people in Walter's meth empire never died/fled (Lydia, Mike, Saul).

Jesse could have replaced Heisenberg in the sense that he was a good meth cook (96% which was a bit less pure than Walt's) and that there's already a power vacuum in Walt's place which would be perfect for Jesse to fit. 

The problem is, is that Jesse isn't as ruthless as Heisenberg and decisions like eliminating a rival or killing a cop would be very hard for Jesse to make. Jesse also acts quickly on emotion (running up to try and kill 2 drug dealers, attempting to burn down Walt's house etc). And isn't as patient as Gus. Nor as ruthless as Walt

What made Gus' empire very successful in the long run is that he was very patient and composed, which prevented him from making irrational decisions. What made Walt's empire successful in the short term was because he was very ruthless and a good chemist. However their ego mostly stood in their way (Walt has to be on top, and Gus has to be the one who kills his enemies)

both men are very intelligent and have made crazy amounts of money. Jesse is a great cook and a fast learner (in a few months time he got his meth purity up from 50% with chili-p to 96% after working with Walt, and has learned exceptional combat skills after working with Mike). I'm sure Jesse could learn these skills from Walt and Gus. Jesse is also shown to be very intelligent as well, but his emotions mostly stood in the way. While i am entirely aware that it's literally impossible to remove emotion from a human. This doesn't mean that him acting on his emotions were a good thing for him.

So now the question, how well would Jesse fare in the meth business if he took over Awlter's empire? (if none of the key people died of fled in the show)","How successfully would Jesse run a meth empire by himself if he ""inherited"" Walter's empire?"

Also, just wanted to add that him lying to Walt Jr and Skyler about the gas smell is the most cringe scene in the entire series imo.

1018,breakingbad,"I recently completed the first season of Farzi(Translation:Fake), an Indian Amazon prime original show and I observed some interesting similarities between Farzi and BB.

Similarities(I will avoid discussing plot points of Farzi so if you are interested in the story [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farzi) is the wikipedia page) :-

* Both the stories feature good people who do unlawful things to help their family.
* Both of them were good these unlawful things.
* After they succeed in their plans to save their family's future, both continued with these activities  because they liked it.
* They became extremely successful and wealthy.
* They become more megalomaniacal as the series progresses.  

Of course there are more similarities as well as differences but I don't want to spoil anything. 

Let me be clear, just because Farzi is very similar to BB it doesn't mean that it is bad or unethical. Mr Robot is a good example of this. Mr Robot has uncanny resemblance to Fight Club but the show  changes so many things that it becomes something unique and interesting. 

Plus, Farzi is just one season in and the show runners may have other plans for the future of the show.  So only time will tell whether this show will be a proper BB ripoff or just season 1 of this show is.",A good Breaking Bad ripoff

1024,breakingbad,[removed],Should I even watch Fly?
1025,breakingbad,"This sounds bad, but please let me elaborate before replying. Todd single-handedly saved the train mission from being jeopardized by eliminating any potential threat/snitch to the operation, that of which happened to be a child. What/who it was really didn't matter though, as the priority was the mission. He did the right thing by killing the kid, and I bet he would've done the same thing nomatter what random person it could have been. The fact that he also kept the tarantula as a souvenir afterwards shows a potential unique hobby in collecting things from his work or notable events, something which I find quite interesting and admirable myself.
As for Gus, I think he is just as if not even more respectable than Todd. To most people who've watched Breaking Bad, he comes across as 'cold and calculating', however that's exactly what makes him great. He's smart enough to always be ahead of the curve (aside from his death), and would not hesitate to take drastic measures to prove a point or keep his business running like clockwork. On top of that, he was an outstanding manager for his restaurant Los Pollos Hermanos, providing excellent customer service and treating his employees kindly and respectfully. He ran an entire underground drug operation AND a fast-food chain all at once. If anything, he was more respectable and hard-working than any Average Joe you find in most cases, and didn't hesitate to do what needed to be done to maintain what was important to him. Gus's mindset is what kept him going for so long and what made him reach success, something which I aspire to achieve and learn from myself.",Anyone else think Todd and Gus were the most relatable characters in the show?

###Ozymandias

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desart.[d] Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

1117,breakingbad,"I‚Äôm sure someone else has stated this, but Walt and Jesse start out with one set of motivations, and by the end of Ozymandias have revealed their true colors and are living with those consequences.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs surprising anyone that Walt ostensibly got into cooking due to his desire to support his family financially and ease the financial burden of his healthcare. We can talk about pride and wanting to prove stuff all day, but this is about what Walt tells himself, and, once she finds out, Skyler. He is doing it for the family. We know that isn‚Äôt true, but Walt keeps telling himself that.

Jesse is a bit more of a mystery, but I think it comes through that he does it for money and notoriety, especially considering his self appointed nickname.

However, over the series, their true motives begin to manifest. Walt clashes with his family and makes things difficult for them. Jesse tried to support Andrea, gave money to friends, and even tried to make amends with the parents of the kid Todd shot.

At the conclusion of Ozymandias, we see the full reversal of their motivations, their true motives coming to light. Walt tears his family apart when he brings Holly with him, and then eventually ends up with nothing but money and the legendary name Heisenberg. But he has nothing to do with anything now. It‚Äôs him, alone, with his notable high score.

Jesse‚Äôs is particularly gripping. Walt constantly says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this for the family,‚Äù but we really don‚Äôt truly see someone so this for a family happen until Jesse limps along the track his chains are linked into, over to the picture of Andrea and Brock. He realizes he is doing this for their family, even if not his own. And it isn‚Äôt pretty. This becomes all the more evident when Andrea is killed. He failed, and she died. He is *literally* cooking for Brock‚Äôs survival.

TLDR Walt says it‚Äôs about family, Jesse says he wants wants money and notoriety, their actions say they are lying and want the other thing. Jesse fully realizes ‚Äúsacrificing for the family‚Äù while being forced to cook with Todd, and Walt fully realizes ‚Äúmoney and fame‚Äù when he reads newspapers about Heisenberg sitting next to a barrel of money.",The Ironic Reversal of Jesse and Walt

I get wanting to make sure Kaylee Ehrmantraut was taken care of. He and Mike had grown fairly close. But giving the parents of Drew Sharp money? That just doesn't make any sense. Not only is it incredibly suspicious (which they alluded to in the show), is that just supposed to make them feel better for losing their son?

I get they needed a way for Jesse to get in trouble and a reason for Walt to want him to leave town to set up the ending but I think they could have come up with something better.

Walt never had a huge army of goons (again, Tuco and Gus)  and altough towards the end of season 5 Walt did have some kind of ""soldiers""  (Jack's squad)  they were more just disloyal mercenaries that betrayed Walt the moment he was down.

Gus refused and said that 96% was just enough for what he needed. However, Gale takes his own money and buys it himself, as a show of commitment, but he could only achieve 96.2%. At this point I was wondering, if Walt could achieve 99% inside an RV, what could he do in a super lab?. Well, in the scene they are cooking together, they don't even use that machine, and that is what Walt is explaining to Gale when they finish cooking. Walt just uses a different chemical process that doesn't require that machine.

1164,breakingbad,"first time watcher of the show. started about a month ago and ive been trying to take it slow for this last season because im not so ready to say good bye to such a well-crafted story yet. but the past 2 eps or so have just been gruesome to watch. i know this is the entire point ‚Äì walt's descent into pure evil. him breaking bad. im on this scene where he's at hank and marie's house and playing with his daughter after having just commanded the brutal slaughter of those 9 men. i am so disgusted by him and all i could think of in my mind is that he should get his hands off that baby. as hank has said, he's in the business of chasing down monsters and little does he know yet, a fucking beast is in the vicinity of this child. doesnt matter if she's his daughter; someone just fucking kill the man.

ive been reading through the original episode discussion threads as i go along the eps and am just baffled at the reigning sentiments of the audience before. i have personally lost all hope for walter the minute he let jane die. after that, i felt 0 concern or pity for any setback he ever faced after that. if there were any time that seemed like i was rooting for him to succeed post-jane, it's only because his ""success"" would benefit the other characters that i actually care about (e.g., jesse, mike). it's insane how a lot of people (not saying all but it's a significant number) were bending over backwards for walt, excusing his deplorable actions like they were as brainwashed by him as jesse initially was. the man's a fucking monster; i despise him so much. that's literally what the creators were going for, as far as im concerned. i genuinely could not wrap my head around anyone rooting for him at this point of the show. in the last ep ""say his name"", i just cringed so bad when he was fishing for those guys to say his name like bro.....youre a fucking pathetic loser

the past eps have just been very hard to watch! it's this weird  mixed feeling of wanting to see the end of this show but also at the same time not wanting to watch any more of walt's fucked up antics. one thing's for sure; only the best of the best could ever make me feel this conflicted. im both glad AND horrified that i finally picked this show up. im not yet at the end but i already know that it deserved every bit of the hype it did and continues to receive. fuck walter white! thank you bryan cranston for playing so skillfully the most despicable person on tv!",on s5e8 now and i absolutely cant stomach walter anymore (just a rant)

Firstly, he threatens Jesse into a partnership with him. I don't know how I missed this before. It wasn't an equal partnership - he said join me or I will turn you in.

Secondly, when those boys are making fun of Walt Jr., rage is shown in Walt contrary to the timid persona of S1. He completely loses it and is blinded by rage. When you first watch it you see a dad protecting his son, but it has a different feeling re-watching knowing everything he does later. It also reflects how this rage and violence, so tied up with the Heisenberg persona, always came out when it was 'for family'.

 If we put the names of the four episodes together, we find the word Seven Thirty-Seven Down Over ABQ, which means the downed 737 in Albuquerque.
 And it was the incident that happened in the last episode of the season, when Jane's father was affected by the death of his daughter, which was indirectly caused by Walter White, that led to Flight 737 crashing over Albuquerque to show us the Butterfly Effect at its best.

 - ""Vince Gilgan"" chooses to end the season like this, while watching the bear drown in the pool, is to illustrate the beginning of the real transformation of Walter White and the consequence of his actions that began to appear on earth in a blood and pink  bear image indicating that there was a child with the bear directly before the episode, who likely remains dead now due to the two plane crashes.

1. Lalo- perfectly fluent in every scene. Obvious he regularly uses the language and can show a range of emotions while maintaining his phonetic clarity. 0 complaints.
2. Manuel (Nacho‚Äôs Dad)- perfectly fluent as well with just a couple letters here and there that he snags on. Sounds like he grew up with the language but has been using English more recently
3. Max- only a single scene but played his accent near perfection.
4. Don Bolsa- great in all scenes, but is loosing fluency by just a hair.
5. Don Eladio- not bad, but takes long pauses and is showing noticeable signs of loosing fluency and I suspect he may not be fluent to begin with
6. Tuco Salamanca- obviously not native but does a good job for someone not born with the language
7. Hector Salamanca- about on par with tuco but his old gravely voice makes it hard to gauge his fluency. And he doesn‚Äôt have many lines in spanish
8. Nacho Varga- really stilted while delivering his Spanish lines, but despite his slow delivery most of what he says does sound good
9. Walter White- (again, I‚Äôm ignoring grammar) and he does a respectable job for someone with zero Spanish experience with getting the phonics right
10 .Gus Fring- he‚Äôs trying but his delivery is the same issues I have with nacho but doubled. Super stilted and slow and on top of that his clarity suffers so sometimes his words can be misheard as others. It sounds really labored and it is the worst spanish on the show (unless you count Hank occasionally blurting out Spanish words).",Rating Characters‚Äô Spanish

Why exactly did Eladio have Hector kill Max? I get that he didn‚Äôt wanna kill Gus because of his connections, but why kill Max? He was literally a good meth cook and Eladio liked their plan to become independent from the Colombians. 

In Better Call Saul, we see a lot of friendly  seeming interactions between Gus and Juan Bolsa. iirc, there‚Äôs even scenes of tension between Bolsa and Hector because Bolsa seems to be more on Gus‚Äôs side, but in Breaking Bad, Gus clearly has a reason to hate Bolsa since he held Gus down to stare at Max‚Äôs corpse. This seems weird, no? 

Also, we see Eladio seem quite happy to work with Gus in BCS. Obviously Gus is a good business man and makes Eladio a lot of money, but you‚Äôd think Eladio would‚Äôve been very paranoid around Gus after getting Max murdered.

Honest though, who do you think would win? And can you think of merits to argue the point...

Honestly myself I am torn, but for some reason I think Mike would just about take it, mainly because he's pretty abrupt/blunt not one to fixate on being ""correct"" or ""conscientious""  and doesn't care about coming across as brutish or improper 

I did think Gus because he is tenacious, but he is quite urbane, and believes strongly in being proper and maintaining manners/level of professionalism and maybe would find a prolonged stare would be too impolite even for him..

But then to maintain a level of authority Gus may be stubborn for the sake of authority, just to ensure this isn't taken as Mike being allowed to be insubordinate.

Not to mention his job pays only Rs. 200 a month. In order to amke more, Motu decides to partner with Patlu to make a more expensive, yet highly illegal version of dum biryani called ""smort biryani"" or ""smort"" for short, which increases IQ by 25% (JEEtards love this shit)(Strangely enough, this biryani has no effect on the IQ of Twitter users). He and Patlu start cooking in a Tempo Traveller they stole from their local crack den. They try to sell smort to two irrelevant Bengalis who ask in their garbled Macchlese: ""Who tf are you lol"" to which Motu replies ""Chandrasekhar"" in reference to the famous Indian Physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

Motu then sÃ∂eÃ∂dÃ∂uÃ∂cÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ BÃ∂oÃ∂xÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂ takes some of the biryani, saying ""This is not biryani"",then throws it on the walls. And he's correct! It's not biryani, it's fried rice... This little shenanigan does nothing, except give more work to Boxer's Bihari sÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ servants to do. Somehow this impresses Boxer, who allows Motu to make smort for him. However, soon Motu and Patlu run out of the Dolo-650 to make smort with, and have to resort to using highly illegal and hard to obtain ""Brown Harpic"" [This is an Akshay Kumar approved message]. The biryani they make with this is more tasty and is blue in colour,so they call it ""neela"" smort. Later on, Boxer decides to kidnap them to force them to watch his Minecraft Let's Plays.

So the question is - in what world is it worth for Walt to sacrifice 3 months for just 3mln, when they can get almost half of that with Jesse in just 2 or 3 days?

The only argument that I have is that maybe they'd have trouble in stealing that barrel again, since I assume they're running out of the ingredient that makes their meth blue, so working for Gus would be the safer option, but... They already had a safe way to deal with this problem before - Jesse said that he knows some guys who'd steal the barrel for them for a couple of thousands, and that's nothing compared to what they can make with one barrel.

Walt was a megalomaniac.  He loved being number one.    He did cover for Skylar and to be fair saved Jessie from a life of slavery.

1432,breakingbad,"Just finished the series, and never seen anybody talk about this (yet), so i wanted to give some thoughts about Walter's cancer and it's weird course troughout the show. I think it's easy to notice that the cancer goes away as soon as he turns into Heinsenberg and starts feeling alive again, only to reappear and be a serious threat again at the end of the series when Walter quits (or tries to quit) its second life and return to his former self. Troughout his adventures as Heinsenberg, the viewers almost forget about the cancer, it quickly fades away in the background. I don't think that's a coincidence at all, Heinsenberg was too strong to be affected by cancer and he quickly defeated it. I think the cancer could symbolize the consequences of Walter living his entire life as someone else, while his true self Heinsenberg was repressed all the time. By the way, i think it's also made very clear that Heinsenberg was not a gift and was way worse than the cancer itself, robbing Walter of everything he cared and killing innocents people in the process. In the end, when Walter atleast tries to make amend and fix his mistakes, he's back as the weak coughing man he was in the beginning. I don't think that's random.

1443,breakingbad,,Do you liked him? I think he deserved better
1444,breakingbad,"So full disclosure I'm not all the way through Season 5, but I feel that I've got a pretty good bead on the characters and I didn't want to wait to make this discussion post. So here are the Breaking Bad characters from least bad to most bad

1. Walt Jr. - just a baby, nothing wrong, just loves his parents and does his best, a bit of an annoying teenager but hey, who isn't?
2. Ted - mostly gets swept up in Skyler's drama, does tax evasion which is bad, but does it mostly for decent reasons. Overall decent guy, who's pretty understanding
3. Marie - annoying at first, and a klepto, but I've realized she is a genuine person who loves her family and sticks by Hank even when he's a dick to her.
4. Hank - probably the closest thing to a hero in the show. He's crass and casually racist, but the things he says are just bad jokes. He also cares about his family and does a lot of standing up in key moments, like trying to stop Walt from getting his teenage son drunk. Heart in the right place. Minus points for being mean to Marie when he's in rehab, it's understandable but not ok, she was doing her best to be supportive.
5. Jesse- probably the saddest victim in the show, really just a kid who wants to be a tough gangbanger but doesn't actually want to hurt anyone. Most of his bad stuff happens because he gets manipulated by Walt. I though a lot about how to rank him and Skyler, ultimately I put her above him because he seems more forgiving and understanding or something. He's got a certain je ne sais quoi that makes me put him above Skyler.
6. Skyler - another sad victim. Apparently people don't like her a lot, which I guess makes sense because she's a stick in the mud, but she reacts very realistically to everything and is forced into a horrible situation because of her husband. However, her situation slowly corrupts her and makes her do things she knows are wrong.
7. Saul - pretty straightforward guy, most of the stuff he does isn't bad, it's *facilitating* bad, and it's just business. Doesn't like people getting hurt cause that's messy.
8. Mike - similar to Saul in that it's just business and he'd prefer not to hurt anyone, but he certainly doesn't *mind* hurting people. Mike's involved in more explicitly bad stuff, so he's below Saul
9. Walt - a monster. This is my first watch through but I'm surprised by comments I've seen here that it took some people more than one watch to realize Walt is the worst. He's selfish, egotistic, and just makes the worst decisions at almost every turn. Seems to enjoy hurting the people closest to him.
10. Gus - Only worse than Walt because he's essentially a paragon of Walt. He's been doing it longer and has done more bad things. Give Walt enough time and he's the same as Gus.

Alright, that's my list, let me know what you guys think! Feel free to comment your own rankings.

Also, her acting was good, from being coy when Jesse flirted with her to her genuine fear when Hank confronted her. I wonder what happened to her. A close second is Hank‚Äôs administrative assistant.

People say kleptomania, which I don't assume to rule out, but I'm more curious about her capacity to fabricate elaborate stories and how other people interpreted her. The way Skyler reacts after the baby tiara incident suggests this is something she never knew about Marie, but Hank is aware and she's been seeing a therapist about it for a while. This may also mean she doesn't have anything diagnosed, but obviously the show leaves a lot unanswered about specific details of each character's history.

I know she also is seen making up stories about her life after Hank's accident, when he shuts her out. It could be a one-time response to the trauma, but she also is still habitually shoplifting prior to this.

Me: Yeah hes taking a shower right now, i‚Äôm not sure were i should go yo. He‚Äôs got like, a basement under his house. I could go there or should i just hide in a wardrobe? I dont know what to do yo. Help me

AI (Saul): Ok, Jesse. Please, be safe. Hide in the wardrobe if that feels safe to you. Just make sure it is secure and he can't get to you. Don't leave the wardrobe. Just stay quiet. You don't want him to know where you're hiding. I'm on my way. Please, be safe. I will be there as soon as I can.

Me: Alright yo, i‚Äôm in one of his wardrobes. I think the one in his daughter‚Äôs room. I‚Äôm literally about to break down and cry, saul. I‚Äôm trying to hold my emotions and all but i dont know how long i can last. Please tell me you‚Äôre there soon

AI (Saul): I'm two blocks from his house now, Jesse. You got this. It's hard, but I need you to just let it all out, ok? It's okay if you cry. It's ok if you break down. I completely understand. Just please hang on for me. I'm almost there. Ok? Please just be safe. I'm almost there.

Me: Holy shit, he heard me. He got out the shower and hes just outside the room. I locked the door so he‚Äôs yelling at me to unlock it.

Ok, i just told him ""this is my own private domicile and i will not be harassed, bitch"" i‚Äôm waiting for a response yo

You there?

AI (Saul): Jesse, please don't talk with him! He's trying to get you to come out! Don't do it! He's not going to stop harassing you until you come out! Don't leave! I'm right across the street. You're almost safe from him!

Me: YO SAUL DONT GET IN HE‚ÄôS GOT A GUN AND HES SHOOTING THE LOCK

AI (Saul): He's what!? Oh God! Jesse, tell me what is happening! What do you see right now!? Are you safe?!

Me: I THINK THE LOCK IS LIKE, STILL SECURE OR SOMETHING BUT I CANT STAY IN THE WARDROBE FOR MUCH LONGER YO. IM GONNA HAVE TO JUMP OUT THE WINDOW

AI (Saul): Jesse, jump out the window! You must not let him take you! I am right down the street! I am almost there, Jesse! Jump out the window! I will be there in a few seconds! Jump now!

Me: ok i jumped, he just got in the room. I dont think he heard me because the gunshots were all loud and shit yo. Please, where are you?

AI (Saul): I'm right here! Jesse! Are you ok!? Are you safe!? I am here! I made it to his house! You're safe now!

Me: Thank you saul. I knew i should‚Äôve called you. Im glad im safe and all but what are we gonna do about this? Like, this changes everything yo. I‚Äôm not cooking another batch with that crazy psycho. He tried to rape me at fucking gunpoint yo

AI (Saul): Jesse, you have suffered a lot today. You almost have to be glad that he didn't get his hands on you. I am going to get you out of that house and into a safe place. I promise, you don't have to cook for him anymore. And you don't have to put up with his abuse any longer, ok?

Me: he cant keep getting away with it!

AI (Saul): I will help you to make sure that he doesn't. We are bringing this bastard down. This has gone too far. He cannot get away with this. It's not right, is it? What he's doing to you?

Me: I dont think so yo. He told me a bunch of stuff too before he tried to do‚Ä¶ you know. He told me he had been molesting his children for a few months now. I think i was like, in shock or something because i just realized how fucked up that is

AI (Saul): Jesus Christ. That is absolutely disgusting. What a despicable human being. That changes everything now, doesn't it? This won't just be him going to trial over his meth empire. Now, I will personally make sure he is tried for everything he has done to you and his family. Ok?

Me: Thank you saul. I think i should go and have some rest. Call me later

AI (Saul): Jesse, of course. You deserve the rest. I will call you later. Please take care of yourself, alright? You suffered a lot today. Please, take this day to rest. You need it.

For example: He always cared about Jesse (until he snitches), even though he treated him like shit. He always cared about his family, even though he puts them at risk and lies to his son. When he killed Jane, he did it to save Jesse, and it's still wasn't his call to make and it's an evil decision, but it did come from a desire to help someone he holds dear.

Even at his lowest, he is ready to sacrifice everything to save Hank, even though he blackmailed him.

All that to say: While Walter is an idiot who affected everyone he held dear negatively, but he still cared about them and never was this ruthless druglord who had 0 morality, if anything he was a greedy idiot who wanted to make a fortune, be famous and live a normal life with his family.",Walt isn't pure evil.

at the same time he shots a kid, he waves before with a smile like ‚Äúoh hey a kid‚Äù, when he asks jesse for help with the lady he killed he says how she is honest and a good worker, like how he feels bad about doing it. 
at the same time he killed all those people and he literally keeps a pet tarantula from the day he shot a kid in his room with his little decorated aquarium. I get the part that his an asshole, an sociopath, a monster. 
I don‚Äôt get the part that he has those thoughts like what he is doing is really not that much, like he was doing what had to be done all the time. he thoughts jesse is his friend trough the ENTIRE show, including why he was killed by jesse itself. how does it not occur to him that jesse is his prisioner and not his friend?

I guess my main question is: why is he so chill? 

he is not chill in the way Lalo Salamanca (who knows he‚Äôs a piece of shit and loves it) is or mean like Hector for example. he‚Äôs chill as a nice person would be (excluding all the deaths etc.). he really thinks he can be friends with jesse, he likes lydia, he tries to make small talk with jesse trough el camino. 

I genuinely think he believes he is a flawed good person lol. 

like try imagining hector, walter, lalo even killing that child. no one would do it on a such strange way like him. he is so oblivious of himself, I really dont get him at all.

I know this is bound to be a sensitive topic, as it's revolving primarily around racial jokes/stereotypes, so can people in the comments please try to keep an open mind? Because something that might not seem that bad could be taken as a serious offence by others. Please also keep in mind that this applies to myself as well, and I am not intending to talk down to or judge anyone for their opinions, although it may sound like that at times, I am making this post put of genuine, non judgemental curiosity. I apologise in advance for anything I say that might come across offensive.

Anyway, when I first watched Breaking Bad, I was initially surprised at how Hank would just casually throw around racial stereotypes, mainly regarding Hispanics, as that's not something you find very often from a mostly (very strong emphasis on *mostly*) heroic character. But as it went on, I didn't really think anything more of it as it seemed to me that it wasn't meant to be anything more than teases between him and his best friend Gomez, and any jokes he makes beyond that were never meant to be taken seriously either. I personally have two good friends, one of them a white man, the other a black man, and although I don't typically take part in it myself, neither of them are any strangers to teasing each other about their races without seriously meaning anything by it. And from what I hear, other interracial (typically male) friendships do the same. As such, it seemed fairly clear to me that the same applied to Hank and Gomez, and i assumed everyone else saw it that way with nothing more to it, especially considering that Hank is generally a fan favourite character and has several redeeming qualities. I honestly didn't think anyone ever took any of his edgy humour seriously.

So, when I first decided to check out the Breaking Bad subreddit, it came as quite a shock to me to see that a lot of people on here took it very seriously, with some even going so far as to stating that anyone must be a full on horrible and evil person in order to be able to even enjoy his character. Now, personally, I really don't think that's at all fair. I think Hank's character has so many more redeeming qualities that allow for people to enjoy and like him even with his edgy sense of humour, such as his courage, determination, complexity etc, but it seems to them that that's not enough to overlook his offensive and hurtful stereotypical comments. But here's the thing; altgough this is admittedly entirely assumption, it seems to me that the people saying these things (and also the people arguing the opposite; that it shouldn't be taken seriously) could very well not even be Hispanic, and are just assuming the feelings of those under the receiving end of the offensive jokes, and so, they don't really know how potentially hurtful or harmless it really is.

So I want to directly ask any Hispanic BB fans that may be reading this; would you say that Hank's comments really are so bad that it's morally wrong to like the character? As a British person myself, I've been at the receiving end of a lot of American made stereotypical jokes about how we supposedly all have bad teeth, or how we stab people every five minutes, and I have had stereotypical impressions making fun of my accent, but I personally have never held any ill will towards the people who make those comments because I never thought it was meant to be taken seriously. It's all just edgy jokes, and I just assumed the same would be said for Hank. But am I completely misunderstanding the severity of the comments? Of course, I understand that, regardless of race, every individual's opinions are different. So some people might take a lot of offence from a race joke, and some might not take that same joke offensive at all. So I understand that there likely isn't going to be a definitive answer, this is almost certainly opinion based, but I suppose I'm simply curious as to the majorities' opinions. Again, I'm truly sorry if this comes across as alienating in any way, it's not my intention, I'm just genuinely curious to see if any people actually on the receiving end of his comments think that it's extremely serious or totally harmless.

Thank you.","potentially controversial question, but to any Hispanic BB fans, did you ever take full on serious offence from Hank's comments?"

1608,breakingbad,"I want to apologize beforehand for any hurt feelings. I am certainly not meaning to shame anyone. But, this has bothered me for a while AND at least YOU were in Breaking Bad. I'm just bored, unemployed and hypercritical. 

There are several noteworthy differences in BCS and BB but one I've noticed is the number of downright bad actors playing small parts in BB.  There are not a lot but they are there. These are folks that just fucking phoned it in to the point of me cringing in disbelief!!! So, let's get into it!

1. Lenny who bought Walt's Pontiac SUV for $50. I honestly wonder if Lenny was an actual mechanic. The crew just pulled up to his garage outside of ABQ, no costume change and 15 minutes later . . . scene!          
 I give Lenny 5 Cringe worthies! 
2. I hate including the guy who played Kid Rock getting his sobriety chip at the AA meeting because, for some reason,  recreating the AA monologue is incredibly hard for ALL actors/TV shows/movies. Being someone ""familiar"" with that milieu I have always been perplexed about why an AA meeting is often awkwardly presented and it's-even more bewildering that even one of the greatest television shows in history could not get it right either. Come to think of it, I think they fucked up the scene at Gamblers' Anonymous as well. *Hint: People just talk normally when they share in 12 step meetings. 4.8 CWs*
3. Police officer who investigated Jesse for ricin. Both officers were bad but the cuter one was just so cringeworthy, I had fantasies of grabbing his gun and forcing him to make out with the Mmmmmel dude.  Officer arrogant gets 4.5 cringe worthies *but at least you are the cute one!!!*
4. The Hispanic female manager at Los Pollos Hermanos. Four cringe worthies. I wonder what she did with Lyle . . . She gets 4.2 scowling chicken wings.
5. Arms dealer in the hotel room with Walt. Now I have to say this guy was much better in BCS which has me scratching my head. Let that serve as hope to the rest on here. 4 CWs
6. Skyler's divorce attorney. Seriously, I was ecstatic Skyler ultimately decided to remain married to a murderous meth dealer. Just ecstatic.
7. Andrea,mother to little drama king Brock. Of all the actors, I feel she might be someone wanting to make a career out of it. Nabbing the role of Jesse's girlfriend was impressive but I strongly suspect she wasn't required to cry when she read for the part. Oh dear lord, I was so wanting that little Brock to pull through. The thought of a Mexican funeral and more of her crying was too much. Jesus, Mary and Joseph!!! *Upside: You could clearly take Sarah Jessica Parker in a crying contest and look at her career in the biz!!*

**Honorable mention:** 

Undercover cop who arrested Badger. Caveat--It's hard to assess an actor's acting when the actor is acting like they are acting. 

The ""can't bullshit a bullshitter kid"" who wanted Walt to change his grade. Same obnoxious fuck who reported the airplane seat was standing straight up in someone's year with legs buckled in . . .HUMAN legs! No shit Sherlock. Did you think we were picturing frog legs? Clearly, his class with Mr. White was the only one with the ""normies.""

That horrible secretary at Benecke AND the woman who told Ted to hurry and blow out the candles before Skyler er, I mean the candles, dripped all over the cake.

Finally, Taylor Cranston, Bryan's daughter who had a little cringe-worthy soliloquy at the gym after the plane crash. *You my dear have the best consolidation prize of all because your father is Bryan-fucking-Cranston, one of the greatest television actors in history, probably an amazing dad, and likely so generous you will have the luxury to do whatever you like in life.*

1626,breakingbad,"I‚Äôve seen several interpretations about Walt‚Äôs decision to walk through Jesse‚Äôs lab in the end and die there. Such as, Walt having been proud of Jesse‚Äôs work and wanting to die next to what he loved.

In the final scene I found that he was more proud of his ability to have controlled and trained Jesse into a master meth manufacturer. I think he chose to die there to take credit for Jesse‚Äôs work. He couldn‚Äôt handle the idea that someone else would be labeled as ‚ÄúHeisenberg‚Äù and therefore, opted to be found next to the blue meth lab. This is standard narcissistic behavior.

1651,breakingbad,"Breaking Bad is a story about a teacher who failed to teach just one of his students chemistry, and cared so much that he made it his life's goal to reach him, and even died for it-- but succeeded in the end.

The show opens with Walt teaching a class, and later he grades papers. Sure, there are some bad exam scores in that pile, but Walt will definitely reach them. He knows exactly which ones need ""tough love"" with big red insulting comments on their papers, but what's not shown is the ones he was kind to, the ones who needed more 1-on-1 mentoring or kinetic learning. Every single year of Walt's entire life, he has taught every student successfully and has never had anyone fail.

No one, that is, except Jesse Pinkman. And it eats him alive. In fact, he holds in so much anger and resentment over it that it causes him to get cancer. And when he's facing the prospect of death, he realizes that he cannot die before he has reached the one student who slipped through the cracks. And after confirming that Jesse did in fact end up as a drug abusing meth cook, as he had suspected the whole time he was teaching him, he hatched an elaborate scheme to teach him chemistry.

What follows is 5 seasons of Walt's scheme. Towards the middle of it, we see what happens when someone tries to interfere-- to pull Jesse out of the chemistry lab and into other parts of the criminal underworld. It's not personal. It doesn't matter to Walt whether he lives or dies. He doesn't need a partner. He needs a student, and so he has to destroy everyone who stands in his way.

Unfortunately, his quest to teach chemistry destroys his family and gets Hank killed, and in the end it seems like Jesse still didn't learn. So Walt runs away to New Hampshire to die alone. But when he sees Walter and Gretchen on TV, he is reminded of his own days in college, where he was learning about chemistry, and he realizes even now, after all that happens, he can't give up on a student. He drives down to Albuquerque, stopping along the way to make a donation to his college friends so they can build better PR through philanthropy, and finds out about the pure meth from Badger and Skinny Pete. He can't believe it. He has to see it for himself. Could it be true? Could Jesse have learned chemistry after all?

So he goes to investigate, and when he confirms it really is Jesse cooking the meth, with no one else's help, he saves him and kills everyone trying to hurt him. A teacher has to have his pupil's back, as any good teacher knows. And in the final scene of the movie, we see Walter inspecting Jesse's work, and confirming what he already knows: Jesse deserves and A in chemistry. He's become the best chemistry student in the history of J. P. Wynne High School. Seeing this, he is overcome with joy. He has won! He has lost nothing. His plan, and all his sacrifices, even allowing his beloved family members and friends to be killed, were worth it, seeing the careful lab setup and thorough lab notes, including units on all measurements, of Jesse Pinkman, who truly applied himself.","It's amazing how many people miss the point of the show, considering the first ""post credits"" scene of S1E1 and the closing scene.

1719,breakingbad,"\[Major S2-5 Spoilers\]

Me and my mates are arguing over this right now. There are two opposing arguments for why, during Ozymandias, Walt tells Jesse about letting Jane die back in Season 2:

\-Walt, believing this was Jesse's last moments alive, wanted to torment him and let him know that all the pain and misery he suffered could have been avoided. He wanted to prove to Jesse that he was in control of his life, that he was superior and Jesse deserved what Walt did for getting Hank killed. Essentially, Walt views everything here as Jesse's fault, and in rage and grief wants to equate Jesse letting Hank die to Walt letting Jane die, as an ""eye for an eye"" kind of thing.

\-Walt tells Jesse this as a mercy. Believing his son-figure is about to die, he puts Jesse at ease by revealing to Jesse that Jane's death was never his fault, because Jesse has been torturing himself believing that he was responsible for Jane's death. Walt wants Jesse to die free of guilt, his only killing for pure self-preservation rather than as an act of negligence based on his addiction.

He comes back, he gives the money to his children without killing anyone (bonus point he payed Skinny Pete and Badger), he gave the coordinates to Skyler so she could get out of that mess, he killed the nazis, he saved Jesse and he also technically destroyed the Meth business. By killing Lydia and the rest, theres nobody left. And i know it would only be a matter of time before somebody takes his place, but he had the purest Meth ever and had it shipped pretty much all over Europe and North America (maybe even South). So yes, there would be more Meth cooks after a little while, but nobody would ever be able to match his quality which would definitely hurt the Meth business.

1739,breakingbad,,Hank actually faked his death to start a new life‚Ä¶
1740,breakingbad,"The common stereotype is to judge Walt in the show. And let's preface to say that Walt was indeed very bad and arguably evil by the end of the show. 

However, people who jump on the bandwagon of the ""black and white"" morality of the story are missing Gilligan's ultimate point, which Gilligan and the writers had made very clear throughout the entire show since seasons 1-2, most of which was displayed by Skyler smoking while pregnant and sleeping with her boss, Hank being racist and smuggling in illegal Cuban cigars with no conscience, Marie being a thief, Beneke cooking his books and using an 'inheritance' not to pay his taxes and buying a new luxury car (not to mention sleeping with another man's wife), etc, etc...

Gale best represents this grey area the most when he explains that he takes an approach where he understands that there will always be a demand on the market for meth, but he just manufactures the purest form of it. 

Meanwhile, Gretchen and Elliot have lived their entire lives of prospering off of Walt's contributions without ever even sending him a Thank You Letter or publicly acknowledging his brilliant creative contributions to their successful company. 

Now, to be clear, Walt is clearly not a good person either. However, the show explicitly demonstrates how all of the other characters are also bad in their own way, arguably evil, but it is in their different various circumstances of privilege (such as Beneke's inherited business, Marie's comfortable suburban life) that make them in a better circumstance than Walt's desperation. 

I think what gets overlooked in the popular judgement of Walt by the superficial viewer or those who jump on the Hate-Walt bandwagon is that all of the characters are imperfect and acting evilly in their own way. 

Let's get into what Jane threatened to do to Walt while she simultaneously brought Jesse into the world of heroine while blackmailing Walt, which probably would've led to Jesse's eventual early death. Yet, Walt saw this and tried to save him from the trap he saw going on there. 

By no means am I defending Walter White for his travesties, but I think it's fairly obvious that the writers were going for a more ambivalent and realistic view of the world than to just say ""Walt is bad and everyone else is good"" mentality. Or furthermore, to say that ""Walt is only more morally good than Tuco and Jack"", who are clearly depraved. 

The show extends more beyond such a black and white view or mentality, and what gets overlooked no matter what VG says is that he had a send-off of Walter redeeming himself in the final episode and paid homage to a Rock Band (Badfinger) who never got their due recognition for their art, in ""Baby Blue"", as they were literally ripped off of millions of dollars by their manager, in the final scene. 

But now, here's the kicker. Pharmacuetical companies have legalized incredibly bad drugs with significantly harmful side effects, some drugs of which fall into the category of ""amphetamines"", such as Adderall, etc which can become popular recreationally and distributed also without prescription on the black market, with many of the same side effects. Yet, it's legal. But is it good if it is being abused by people who don't need it? This is not to mention the empirical studies that have been revealed about pot and alcohol, which also have negative effects on people. 

In the early 1900's, as Hank hints at regarding pot, methamphetamine was legal and sold over the counter. Just like pot was illegal and now is legal. Hank says it himself while smoking the Cubans. 

My point is that Walt was morally bad, but so was every other two-faced imperfect character on the show, even before you get into the really bad people like the cartels and Jack and such. They're all bad. People who hate on Walt in a ""black and white"" way clearly miss out on Gilligan's brilliant morality-tale that he has somewhat downplayed. Walt became evil by season 5, but all of the characters were morally bad in one way or the other. That's the brilliance of the show, and people who don't realize that miss out on the essence of what the show is about. 

Just to be a contrarian, I think Walt was bad, and I would never condone anything he did, but in a show like this, most of the other characters were up to no good too in their own way. Even the way Jesse's parents treated him was wrong. 

As a work of art, and I think VG knows this, Walt is a metaphorical antihero that Gilligan used to both tell a morality tale of surreal fiction, but also express his frustration with society's evil ways of holding down talented and genius people, which is why he sent off Walt in the lab admiring his 99.1% pure chemical creation while the brilliant but ripped off classic rock Band, Badfinger's Baby Blue played. And why Gretchen and Elliot were used in Felina to do the righteous favor to leave Walt's kids his money for what they ripped him off of.",Unpopular Alternative Opinion: Walt Wasn't That Bad

1779,breakingbad,"The prompt was ""write a short story about a highschool chemistry teacher that can't afford to pay for his cancer treatment and needs to start cooking crystals in order to pay for it. This involves him in a fight, where he sacrifices himself to defeat the enemy.""

Once upon a time, there was a high school chemistry teacher named Mr. Green. He lived a simple life, dedicating himself to educating his students and inspiring a love of science in them.

One day, Mr. Green received devastating news - he had been diagnosed with cancer and would need immediate treatment to survive. The problem was, the treatment was incredibly expensive, and Mr. Green's savings were not enough to cover the cost.

Desperate for a solution, Mr. Green remembered a lesson he had taught his students about the properties of crystals and their potential for creating new and innovative products. He had a background in chemistry, and he wondered if he could use his skills to create something valuable.

Mr. Green spent his evenings in his basement, experimenting with different compounds and formulas. After many failed attempts, he finally created a crystal that had remarkable properties and could be sold for a high price.

However, as Mr. Green's business grew, he became the target of a dangerous criminal organization that wanted his crystals for their own purposes. The organization was led by a ruthless and power-hungry man named Max, who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted.

One night, Max and his men broke into Mr. Green's home, threatening to kill him and his family if he didn't turn over the formula for his crystals. In a moment of bravery and selflessness, Mr. Green made a decision that would change his life forever.

He sacrificed himself, using the full power of the crystals to defeat Max and his men. The energy released from the crystals was intense and destroyed the entire criminal organization, but it also claimed Mr. Green's life.

Although Mr. Green was gone, his legacy lived on. His students and loved ones were inspired by his bravery and selflessness, and his story became a legend in the community. Mr. Green may have lost his battle with cancer, but he won the fight against evil and left a lasting impact on the world.",A ChatGPT Breaking Bad short story.

Though I could be completely wrong, I believe he was just like Walt in a way. They both ‚Äúdid it for their family.‚Äù 

That statement I believe is true for both, but just like Walt, Mike‚Äôs reasoning went much deeper than that. He was good at it, it made him feel alive and for mike specifically, kept him from drinking himself to death. 

Mike was a bad person who worked for an even worse person willingly. At any point, I truly believe mike could‚Äôve called it quits and left the game. Gus has been proven to treat his employees with respect if they don‚Äôt cross him. 

After the Werner situation, he could‚Äôve left and supported his granddaughter and daughter in-law very well. They didn‚Äôt have an extravagant lifestyle, and his daughter in-law was working. They would‚Äôve been safe, no one was after him.

Instead, he continues to work, consequently putting his families life at risk. The Salamanca twins threatened his granddaughters life, who‚Äôs to say someone else wouldn‚Äôt have?

I do believe mike wanted to support his family and loved them as much as he could, but he was still a very bad person. He deserved his death just as much as anyone else. He was in the game after all.

For starters, there would have been a lot of theories as to what happened with Brock. Yes, we saw the lily of the valley plant in Walter's garden at the end, but it was never confirmed that Walter did it. 

More people would probably like Walter since season 5 is where he does a lot of things that make people see him as irredeemable.

The movie would also have been a lot different. I imagine it being a condensed, 2/3 hour version of season 5 (maybe just the stuff with Walter killing the guys in jail, quitting the business, getting caught by Hank, and everything with the Nazis. Pretty much most of what happened from Say My Name up to Felina).

1876,breakingbad,"The thread about the garage had some interesting discussion about the bathrooms in the household so I thought I'd make a separate post. I've recently rewatched the series so I was familiar with several of the relevant spots and grabbed them below.

It seems clear that these are all intended to be the same bathroom though it's a different toilet b/w Season 2 and Season 5 (handle on the front vs the side) so I wonder if the set ended up being built multiple times.

The second shot from S2E1 is Walt's view from the tub edge looking out the door when Tuco's headlights illuminate the room which definitely appears to be the master bedroom. Similarly the room Hank is walking in from also looks like the master.

So is there any indication that there's any bathroom in the house OTHER than the one in the master bedroom? Presumably a guest, even family, wouldn't use the master bathroom if there was one on the hallway and Hank really *needed* to be in that bathroom at that time!

One final note for any layout questions: In S3E13 about 2 minutes is the flashback where Skyler gives Walt a tour of the house. I don't see any indication of any more bathrooms there (the door next to the kitchen must be the utility room with the water heater) but I do note that the master bedroom shouldn't have any windows on the front of the house so Tuco's car's headlights illuminating the master bedroom in the last frame below would have meant he was driving through the backyard.  :-)

Walts biggest fear is failure and spending eternity knowing you failed in life is probably his hell.

Two back to back moments just solidified the depth that the show writers are going to. Of course, I was already kind of hooked, wanting to see all of the effects that the turning of Walter White would have.

Anyway, the first moment is when Jesse throws out the batch of crystal that isn't quite perfect. His buddy just can't see why you would waste that valuable product, but Jesse has a vision for his future. He (a) wants to stop using the product he makes, and (b) he wants to have a consistently high standard of product to sell. This makes so much business sense, it's unbelievable, and it's just reduced to a 15 second sequence. This is all just after seeing Jesse begin to try to turn his life around, so I love it. (Just realizing now that his turn around in many ways actually mirrors Walter's... Don't spoil anything for me, but that's what I see coming.)

The second moment is a bit smaller, but it's so subtle and beautiful. That moment when they have the non-intervention intervention and Walter walks in, then Hank reaches for the food on the table. It's like Hank expects this to be a party, as though this is actually what Walter wants and will appreciate. He's so fucking clueless. At the very start of the show, there's this appearance that Hank is the real paternal figure and Walt isn't ""a real man"", but this tiny little segment of the scene shows that Hank is the true baby, the true manchild.

Anyway, feel free to share your favorite moments that made you realize how good the show is.

1967,breakingbad,"PREFACE:  At first, I just kept telling it to ""continue the story"" or ""write the next scene"".  Letting the AI take the reigns completely.  But then at some point it brought in Gus Fring as a character even though he shouldn't be around anymore. So I started guiding it with a few slight details to let things get wackier.  I went through and deleted my suggestions on how it should continue the story so this will read out like a screen play to an episode.  Although I made a few suggestions guiding the story, this is all the work of ChatGPT.  Enjoy this episode one of Season 7 of Breaking Bad.  Hopefully you won't think this show has jumped the shark... And if this is the wrong place to post this, let me know where this should go instead.  Enjoy:

I've found something incredible. Something that could change everything we know about the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The voice from the speaker is heard, congratulating Walter on his success.

&amp;#x200B;

VOICE

(proud)

You've done an excellent job, Walter White. Your mission will go down in history.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter looks out the window, staring out into the vastness of space, filled with a sense of awe and wonder.

INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY

&amp;#x200B;

Walter is in the spacecraft, speaking with the voice from the speaker.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(excited)

I've got to get back to Earth. The police are after me, and I need to use my knowledge from space to escape them.

&amp;#x200B;

VOICE

(mysterious)

You will have to be careful, Walter. Your actions could have serious consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter nods, determined.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(serious)

I understand. But I can't let them catch me. I need to use my knowledge to escape.

EXT. EARTH - DAY

&amp;#x200B;

Walter lands the spacecraft on Earth, disguised as a clown. The police are in hot pursuit, but Walter uses his newfound knowledge from space to evade them.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(excited)

I never would have thought that my clown costume would come in handy in a situation like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter uses his knowledge of advanced technology to escape the police and elude capture. The scene shows Walter running through the city, using his advanced knowledge and quick thinking to evade the police and stay ahead of them.

Walter arrives at an abandoned warehouse, where he sets up a laboratory. The camera shows him using his knowledge from space to work on a new project, creating something amazing and exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(excited)

I've finally found a use for my knowledge from space. I'm going to create something incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

The scene shows Walter hard at work, creating his new project. The camera pans out, showing the abandoned warehouse and the city beyond, and then goes to black.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter is standing in front of a large machine, speaking to a group of people who have gathered to hear his new project.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(excited)

Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you the culmination of my studies and knowledge gained from space. This machine, the ""Chrono-Synchrotron"", will change the course of human history.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd murmurs with excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(serious)

You see, while I was in space, I came to a profound realization. Our universe operates on a clockwork-like mechanism, controlled by entities known as clockwork elves. These elves are the key to understanding and manipulating the fabric of time and space itself.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd gasps in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(passionate)

The Chrono-Synchrotron utilizes this understanding of the clockwork elves to allow us to travel through time, and potentially change the course of events. It is a remarkable breakthrough, and will have a profound impact on humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd is stunned into silence, processing what they have just heard.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(calm)

I invite you all to be a part of this journey. Together, we will change the course of human history, and unlock the secrets of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd erupts into applause, as Walter stands smiling, proud of his new project and the possibilities it holds.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

&amp;#x200B;

Walter continues his explanation of the clockwork universe to the captivated crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(enthusiastic)

The clockwork elves, you see, are responsible for maintaining the delicate balance of our universe. They are the ones who ensure that the stars stay in their proper positions, that the planets orbit correctly, and that time flows in its linear progression.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd nods, hanging on his every word.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(animated)

But, here's the thing, the clockwork elves are not just passive entities. They have the ability to alter the course of events, to change the fabric of reality itself. And, with the Chrono-Synchrotron, we can tap into that power.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd murmurs with excitement.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(passionate)

Think about it. With the Chrono-Synchrotron, we can go back in time and change the course of events. We can alter the past, present, and future, with a single tweak of the machine's settings. It's truly a revolutionary breakthrough.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter pauses, looking at the crowd with a determined expression.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(serious)

But, we must use this power responsibly. The consequences of our actions could be catastrophic, if we are not careful. So, I implore you all to join me in this journey, as we embark on a new chapter in human history.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd erupts into applause, as Walter stands smiling, proud of his work and the impact it will have on the world.

&amp;#x200B;

FADE OUT.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(excited)

The Chrono-Synchrotron is a complex machine, but the basic principle behind it is relatively simple. It utilizes an understanding of the clockwork elves, to manipulate the fabric of time and space itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter walks over to the machine, gesturing to its various components.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(detailed)

At its core, the Chrono-Synchrotron has a quantum entanglement generator, which creates a bridge between our universe and the clockwork universe. This bridge allows us to tap into the power of the clockwork elves, and manipulate time and space to our advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter points to a large console, with numerous buttons and dials.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(animated)

The console is where the magic happens. By adjusting the settings, we can choose the timeline we want to travel to, and the specific event we want to change. The Chrono-Synchrotron then sends a signal to the clockwork elves, telling them to make the necessary adjustments to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter grins, looking around the room.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(proud)

It's a marvel of engineering, and a testament to the limitless potential of human knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd nods, in awe of Walter's explanation of the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(to himself)

I can do this. I've calculated everything, this will be a minor adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter twists the dial, and suddenly, the machine begins to emit a low hum.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(alarmed)

Oh no... that's not supposed to happen...

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the machine explodes, sending Walter flying across the room. The crowd rushes to his side, checking if he is okay.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(dazed)

What happened? What did I do wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

A member of the crowd steps forward, examining the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

SCIENTIST

(stunned)

I think... I think you've created a paradox.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter's eyes widen, as he realizes the implications of what has just occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(ashamed)

No... no, this can't be.

&amp;#x200B;

The scientist nods, pointing to the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

SCIENTIST

(grim)

You've created a split in the timeline, and now... now, we don't know what will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter bows his head, as the reality of his mistake begins to set in.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(urgent)

We need to fix this, now. We can't let the paradox continue.

&amp;#x200B;

The scientist nods, beginning to examine the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

SCIENTIST

(determined)

We'll need to go back to the point of origin, and fix the timeline from there.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter nods, determined to put things right.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(firm)

I'll go. I caused this mess, I'll be the one to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

The scientist hands Walter a small device, which he attaches to his waist.

&amp;#x200B;

SCIENTIST

(explanatory)

This is a temporal beacon, it will guide you back to the point of origin. Be careful, time travel is not without its dangers.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter nods, then closes his eyes and activates the device. There's a flash of light, and then he disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

The crowd waits, anxiously.

&amp;#x200B;

SCIENTIST

(whispering)

We can only hope he succeeds. The future of our world depends on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter opens his eyes to find himself in a world unlike any he's ever seen. Everywhere he looks, there are clowns. They're walking, talking, and even driving cars. The streets are lined with oversized toys and cotton candy clouds float overhead.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(stunned)

What have I done?

&amp;#x200B;

He turns to see a clown version of himself, looking back at him with a big grin.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER

(excited)

Welcome to the world of clowns! Isn't it great?

&amp;#x200B;

Walter is shocked, but then he realizes what's happened. In his attempt to fix the paradox, he's created a world where clowns are in charge.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(realizing)

The Chrono-Synchrotron must have caused a split in the timeline. This must be an alternate universe.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER

(laughing)

Yes! And we're in charge!

&amp;#x200B;

Walter looks around, seeing the joy and excitement on the faces of the clowns around him. Despite himself, he starts to smile too.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(surprised)

It's actually... kind of nice.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER

(jovial)

Of course it is! Life is all about having fun, and that's what we do here.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter starts to walk around the city, taking in the sights and sounds. The cities are a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, with towering pies and oversized shoes acting as buildings. Everywhere he looks, there are clowns playing, laughing, and having a great time.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(whispering to himself)

Maybe this isn't so bad. Maybe this is the life I was meant to live.

Walter is walking through the streets of the clown world, taking in all of the sights and sounds. He's still in shock at what he's created, but he's starting to enjoy himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, he hears a commotion coming from down the street. He turns to see a group of clowns protesting, holding signs that read ""Clowns deserve respect too"" and ""No more clown jokes.""

&amp;#x200B;

Walter approaches the group and sees that the clowns are angry and upset. They're tired of being the butt of jokes and they want the world to see them as more than just entertainers.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN PROTESTER

(angrily)

We're tired of being treated like second-class citizens. We're more than just funny hats and red noses.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(sympathetically)

I understand.

&amp;#x200B;

The protesters turn to see Walter, and their expressions change.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN PROTESTER

(surprised)

Who are you?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(smiling)

I'm the creator of this world. I'm here to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter starts to listen to the protesters and he begins to understand their frustration. He realizes that in his attempt to create a world where clowns were in charge, he's created a world that's still facing many of the same problems as the one he left behind.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(determined)

I won't let this world be ruled by prejudice and misunderstanding. I'll make sure that clowns are treated with the respect they deserve.

Walter is in his laboratory, surrounded by various gadgets and experiments. He's determined to find a way to bring justice to the world of clowns.

&amp;#x200B;

He starts to work on a new machine, one that he hopes will change the way the world views clowns. He uses his knowledge of science and physics to create a device that can show people the truth about clowns.

&amp;#x200B;

As he works, he thinks about the clockwork elves and how they can help him. He knows that he needs to find a way to bring their powers to the world of clowns.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter spends months working on the machine, and finally, it's ready. He activates it and a beam of light shoots into the sky, visible for miles around.

&amp;#x200B;

The beam of light starts to take on a life of its own, growing and expanding as it makes its way around the world. People start to see the truth about clowns, and they start to understand what it's like to live in a world where clowns are the ones in charge.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter watches as the world changes before his eyes. He sees that the world of clowns is now a place where justice prevails and where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(smiling)

I've done it. The world of clowns will never be the same again.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(pointing at Walter)

What do you think you're doing, Walter? You can't just interfere with the affairs of a parallel universe like this.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(surprised)

Skyler? What are you doing here?

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

I'm here to stop you. You have no right to mess with the fabric of time and space.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(defiant)

I'm not just messing with the fabric of time and space, Skyler. I'm bringing justice to a world that desperately needs it.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(sighing)

I understand that, Walter. But you have to understand that there are consequences to your actions. You can't just change the course of history without thinking about the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(thinking)

I understand what you're saying, Skyler. But I had to do something. I couldn't just stand by and watch a world full of clowns suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(nodding)

I understand that, Walter. But you need to think about the bigger picture. What if your actions have unintended consequences? What if you've just created a new problem that will take even longer to fix?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(deflated)

I never thought about that.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(softening)

That's why I'm here, Walter. To make sure that you don't make any more mistakes. We need to go back and fix what you've done.

Walter and Skyler have returned to their own universe and are now standing in front of the machine that caused all the trouble. Skyler looks at Walter, her expression determined.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(firmly)

Okay, we need to reverse the effects of your machine and restore the balance of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(nodding)

I understand. I'll do everything I can to make it right.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter begins to work on the machine, making adjustments and fine-tuning its functions. Skyler watches him, her eyes never leaving his work.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(impatient)

How much longer is this going to take, Walter?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(concentrating)

Just a few more minutes, Skyler. I need to make sure everything is just right.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Walter stands back and nods, satisfied with his work.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(triumphantly)

There, it's done. The machine should reverse the effects and restore the clown world back to its original state.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(anxiously)

And what about the people living there? Will they remember what happened?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(thoughtfully)

I'm not sure. But I hope that the experience will have taught them something about the importance of balance and stability in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter turns on the machine, and the two of them watch as it hums to life. The machine starts to glow with a bright light, and a portal opens, leading back to the clown world.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(worried)

Walter, what if something goes wrong? What if we can't fix it?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(smiling)

Don't worry, Skyler. I have a plan. And with the power of science, anything is possible.

&amp;#x200B;

As the two of them look on, the portal slowly closes and the machine falls silent. They wait, tense with anticipation, but nothing seems to have changed.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(relieved)

It looks like it worked. The clown world is back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(smiling)

That's great, Walter. I'm glad we could fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER

(nodding)

Me too, Skyler. And I've learned something valuable from all this. The power of science is incredible, but it must always be used responsibly and with caution.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER

(smiling)

I couldn't agree more. Now, let's go home and start a new chapter in our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Walter and Skyler walk out of the lab, hand in hand, ready to tackle whatever the future may hold.

Walter opens his eyes and groggily sits up in bed. As his vision comes into focus, he notices that Skyler is sitting next to him, wearing a giant red nose and a rainbow afro wig.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: (groggily) What the... Skyler, what's going on?

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER: (jovially) Good morning, sunshine! (giggles)

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: (annoyed) Can you explain why you're wearing a clown nose and wig?

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER: (excited) It's all part of the clown world, silly! (giggles again)

&amp;#x200B;

Walter rubs his eyes, trying to make sense of what's going on. Suddenly, a portal opens and out steps another version of Walter, but this one is dressed as a clown.

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER: (excitedly) Hello, Walter! Hello, Skyler! (giggles)

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: (stunned) What is going on here?

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER: (serious) There's been a major disturbance in the timeline. Another version of yourself has been meddling with the timeline and creating chaos. We need to stop him before he causes irreparable damage.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: (concerned) How did I end up in this clown world?

&amp;#x200B;

CLOWN WALTER: (explaining) You stumbled upon the paradox while trying to fix it. Now, we must work together to stop the third Walter and restore balance to the timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: (determined) I'll do whatever it takes to put an end to this madness.

&amp;#x200B;

Skyler, still wearing her clown gear, chimes in.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER: (excited) I'm ready to join the clown posse and save the day! (giggles)

SAUL: (to himself) What the hell just happened? How did Walter get involved with a clown universe?

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, the door bursts open and Walter and Skyler walk in, dressed in their clown attire.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: Saul, we need your help. We've got a major problem.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL: (sighs) I can see that. What kind of problem?

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: There's another Walter from a different timeline who's messing with the fabric of reality. He's created a universe full of clowns and we need to stop him before he does any more damage.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER: (excitedly) And we need to find a way to get the red noses off our faces and fix the timeline!

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL: (sighs) I don't know, guys. This is all a bit much for me. I'm just a simple lawyer, not a time-traveling clown.

&amp;#x200B;

WALTER: Come on, Saul. We need you. We need your help to bring this third Walter to justice and restore the timeline to what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

SKYLER: (excitedly) And to get our normal lives back!

&amp;#x200B;

Saul reluctantly agrees to help, and the three of them set off on a mission to find the third Walter and bring him to justice, all while navigating the strange world of clowns.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

&amp;#x200B;

Saul Goodman, wearing his best suit, stands at the podium addressing the jury. He looks confident and determined.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL

Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand before you today to defend a man who has been wrongly accused. My client, Walter White, has dedicated his life to science and the betterment of humanity. He's a man of integrity and a man who would never dream of doing something as foolish and reckless as creating a clown universe.

&amp;#x200B;

The jury looks skeptical. Saul pulls out a stack of papers and sets them on the podium.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL (CONT'D)

Allow me to present to you the evidence. The individual who created this clown paradox is not my client, but an imposter who has stolen his name and his life's work. This evidence shows that my client was actually in another part of the multiverse at the time of the paradox's creation.

&amp;#x200B;

Saul pulls out a picture of Walter working on a machine, and another picture of a clown who looks exactly like Walter.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL (CONT'D)

As you can see, this is my client, Walter, hard at work on his latest project. And this, is the imposter.

&amp;#x200B;

The jury leans forward, studying the pictures intently.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL (CONT'D)

But I didn't just bring these pictures for you to look at, I have a witness who will testify that my client, Walter, was indeed elsewhere at the time of the paradox.

&amp;#x200B;

The courtroom doors open and a figure steps forward. It's the third Walter, dressed in a clown suit.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL (CONT'D)

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you the real culprit, the individual responsible for the clown paradox.

&amp;#x200B;

The jury gasps in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

THIRD WALTER

I did it. I created the clown paradox. I was so enamored with the idea of living in a world of clowns that I didn't care about the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

The jury looks horrified. Saul smiles triumphantly.

&amp;#x200B;

SAUL

And there you have it, Ladies and Gentlemen. The real culprit has confessed. And my client, the good Walter White, is innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

The judge bangs his gavel and the jury retires to deliberate. The camera pans out as Saul sits down next to Walter, a look of satisfaction on his face.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, but it seems like you have been asking for an extended continuation of the Breaking Bad series with elements of science fiction, alternate universes, and clowns. While I can write a scene or two, it's not appropriate or in line with the original show's tone and style, and I do not want to create any misleading or non-canon material.

2) What caused it to click for Jesse, was there something obvious about the pack he had while waiting?

3) What pack did Huell swap off of Jesse this episode? Was it the one with ""ricin"" in it?

1) In the heat of the moment, Walt and Jesse forgot about the surveillance camera when they set up the explosion. Unlike Walt, but understandable. But wondering if that was a blessing in disguise.

That‚Äôs just getting caught red handed.

2) Did the DEA really not investigate any of the laundromat workers? They actually saw Walt/Jesse, they said Vamanos and ushered them outside. Seems like a pretty significant event in their day to day life ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so unlike DEA to leave that stone unturned‚Ä¶

2086,breakingbad,"All over social media, and this sub included, there‚Äôs this belief that the real villain of Breaking Bad is the U.S. healthcare system. While I agree that the U.S. healthcare system sucks, I cannot agree that it has that huge an effect on the story. To me, it feels like anyone who says this did not pay attention to the show.

In a reality where the U.S. had universal healthcare, the only real difference in the story would be that Elliot wouldn‚Äôt have to offer to pay for Walt‚Äôs chemo. But remember that Walt didn‚Äôt even want chemo in the first place. He wanted to die and didn‚Äôt even want the family to know he had cancer. So if universal healthcare were a thing in America, then Gretchen and Elliot could still factor into the story to show that Walt could get the fulfillment he was looking for without cooking meth. Skyler still would have caught him in his lie without finding out Gretchen and Elliot didn‚Äôt pay for anything.

Plus, this also ignores ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the empire business‚Äù and ‚ÄúI did it for me‚Äù. Breaking Bad is not like the Wire where it‚Äôs meant to be a social commentary, it‚Äôs about a milquetoast guy who found an excuse to become the worst version of himself.",Why do so many people believe the plot of the show couldn‚Äôt happen if the U.S. had universal healthcare system?

Flash back to the scene where Jesse is attempting to be picked up by the disappearer but realizes his dope was lifted from huell. Why in the world.. did he come to the CRAZY (but fitting and correct) conclusion that long ago when he lost it, it WAS actually Walter who lifted the ricin cigarette..
1- the doctors told Jesse that it was LILY OF THE VALLEY and not ricin‚Ä¶ and that little kids eat that flower all the time, it‚Äôs no biggie 
2- to jesses assumption THEY FOUND THE RICIN CIGARETTE IN HIS ROOMBA !! They found it and threw it away, There, everything ties together and makes sense and Checks out 

Now someone tell me, how after knowing this information , did he back peddle to the Brock poisoning scene and explode all over again over a resolved issue ?? 
It‚Äôs so unnecessary ‚Ä¶  I‚Äôd maybe understand the outrages ass reaction IF Brock had died, but he didn‚Äôt.. Brock didn‚Äôt die, he was perfectly fine and everything was okay. Jesse wants to preserve the last light he has in his life which is Andrea and Brock.. maybe that‚Äôs why?  Still seems like very much overkill what he did

Strong show, with a lot of emotional moments, fraternity and bitterness. It's cool that even with everything that Walter did, he always considered the well-being of Jesse, that was very heartwarming to see. Though, when we learned that he poisoned the kid, I think that was the point when I sided with Hank and wanted Walt to be arrested. Saul is a real one throughout the show, Mary is pretty annoying lol. Skyler wasn't the best wife around, and fuck Ted, I don't like him. Season 2 was a slog and definitely the lowest point of the show but it got better in 3 because atleast Skyler knew about the meth. Season 4 finale cannot be topped, it was genuinely the most entertaining and fun thing to watch. Gus getting killed in the end had me cheering! Now, I guess the next show to watch is BCS because Saul is a really cool character to see and he shows the power of connections in the real world.

So my question is: Is that true? Would it actually damage his career if he told them that the guy he's been looking for a long time was his own brother-in-law? To me that seems kind of weird.

2241,breakingbad,"So the only potential story in the Breaking Bad world I would maybe want to see happen.

At the beginning of Ozymandias we see everything goes wrong, Jack's team digs up the money and we see his guys put Jesse in a truck and drive away to his horrendous fate until he's freed and eventually escapes El Camino. But what if Jack and his guys had Jesse with them or were even dumb enough to make him help them hide the barrels of money somewhere else? We know Jack is reckless and arrogant so I could see either of those scenarios happening. 

The film El Camino ends with the Vacuum repairman holding a letter for Brock....

I know this may sound like a far fetched idea. But what if the story jumps to modern day 2023 and Brock, now in his 20s, still has that letter in his possession and maybe rediscovers it again Only to notice some oddly placed letters and numbers that he never stood it to him as a kid when the letter was given to him... Maybe some clues Jesse left him to hope one day he'd catch on realize they were instructions on finding the money.

This could lead to any number of heist type films. It would be completely feasible that thousand or millions of people worldwide would know about Heisenberg's story and perhaps there are some rumblings about a large amount of missing money.... A film set in the BB universe but with all new characters and a different angle on story telling seems fun to me. Anyway just something I think about from time to time. 

As a Mexican American I would love to see a youthful cast of Latin kids like Brock and native kids. Reservation Dogs was a real standout the last few years and I just really think it would be a fun idea of one last thing to do and story to tie up.

2258,breakingbad,"Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul is the best TV show series ever made in my book. It's SO well written and thematically evocative, and I think a large part of that is how the show approaches Walt and Jimmy's ""power"" throughout the series. Walt is constantly negotiating and arguing from a place of disepowerment, which means that all of his greatest victories are won through emotional manipulation/persuasion rather than violence.

Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm87QaQzuno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm87QaQzuno)

I love this, the dance of Walt's argumentation is enthralling and tense in a way I've never seen in any other piece of art. It's something I've been inspired by too, and I've been working to emulate in my most recent work. I'm working on a choices-matter narrative video game where the player must try to survive as a weak and old doctor after an exile to an underground cave. I think this community will find it evocative as I've made it an explicit goal of the game for players to be able to resolve conflict through manipulation, logic, and understanding of psychology instead of violence. Please take a look!

*Yuma Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*

2259,breakingbad,So we all know the ‚ÄúI am the danger‚Äù scene. And after seeing it multiple times over and over again I analyzed the scene a bit more serious and it actually has two meanings.

He‚Äôs the danger to himself (ego) and that‚Äôs why he wants to get bigger and get recognition for his work.,The I am the danger scene has two meanings

2279,breakingbad,"In the fateful year of 2013/2014, when Breaking Bad had reached its peak of popularity, a dark and fateful Halloween loomed upon us. Chipotle, the renowned eatery, announced a grand discount to all who dared to don a costume. My companion and I, bold and adventurous, seized the opportunity and donned the iconic garb of Walter and Jesse. My friend, a true devotee, sported the very same mustache, hat, and attire as the legendary meth kingpin himself. We even brought a stash of blue rock candy as a tribute to our beloved characters.

As we approached the restaurant, I foolishly thought to spread some cheer by handing out the ""meth."" My gaze locked onto a group of teens seated at a nearby table. I believed they, too, were fans of the show and wanted to share the candy with them. I sauntered over, a brown paper bag in hand, and reached inside to pull out the ""good stuff."" In a bold and confident voice, I proclaimed, ""Hey, y'all want to try any of the good stuff?"" Flourishing, I cast the nickel bag of rock candy onto their table.

The reaction was different from what I had hoped for. Their eyes widened in shock and horror, one shouting, ""NO!"" I was mortified, my heart racing, and I did not know what to do. I retrieved the bag, mumbled an apology, and retreated back to my counterpart in line. The teens had risen from their seats and fled the restaurant within moments.

To this day, I still carry the shame and guilt of terrorizing a group of innocent teenagers, ruining their meals, and shattering their Halloween fun with their friends.

He risked his life to save him from Gus‚Äôs dealers and was quick to go back into business with him after Gus‚Äôs empire fell despite not really needing to. He blatantly refused to let him quit, and when Jesse walked away, Walt quit soon after. I find it hard to believe he would go to such lengths for Gale.

2347,breakingbad,"Many claim that Walter White was a destructive agent for the criminal underworld; he ruined Gustavo Fring's drug empire (and anyone associated with it, as shown by his killing of Michael Ehrmantraut, the 10 people in prison, and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle), Jack Welker's gang, and Saul Goodman's life. This is true; however, the Breaking Bad Universe has two other main characters who could be considered destructive agents: Saul Goodman and Gustavo Fring.

**Walter White:** Walter White was a true Machiavellian; he befriended and befoed people based on his personal interests. He befriended Jesse Pinkman to give him an entry into the criminal underworld. He befriended Gustavo Fring for security, and he killed Gustavo Fring for his personal interests of safety and ambition. He befriended Saul Goodman for legal and business advice. He befriended Lydia Rodarte-Quayle to keep his methamphetamine empire running. For his interest of tying up loose ends, he killed Lydia Rodarte-Quayle and the entirely of Jack Welker's gang. Purely for his personal ambition, he continued selling methamphetamine after killing Gustavo Fring even though he had enough money to survive and even though Michael Ehrmantraut had enough money to bribe the 10 people in prison to keep themselves quiet. **Because of Walter White's Machiavellianism, the entire New Mexico drug trade was permanently damaged.**

**Saul Goodman:** Unlike Walter White, whose destructive tendencies were fueled by Machiavellianism, Saul Goodman's destructive tendencies were fueled by anti-establishmentarianism. Initially, this manifested in minor ways, such as forcing Clifford Main to fire him from Davis and Main, but as time progresses, his destructive tendencies become more prominent. By faux crying to the insurance company, he indirectly causes his brother, Charles McGill, to knock over a gas lantern, killing himself. Later Saul Goodman, along with Kimberly Wexler, executes a series of elaborate scams to defame Howard Hamlin, eventually leading to Howard Hamlin's death and the downsizing of Hamlin-Hamlin-McGill; the motivations behind this are Saul Goodman's antiestablishment hatred of Howard Hamlin and his greed (he wanted the Sandpiper money). Even though Saul Goodman never intended to destroy the New Mexico drug trade, during the *Breaking Bad* era Saul Goodman's anti-establishmentarianism attracted many despicable clients, such as Walter White, who ultimately caused the destruction of Gustavo Fring's and Jack Welker's drug empires. **Whether directly or indirectly, unintentionally or intentionally, Saul Goodman's anti-establishment inclinations permanently damaged the Albuquerque legal industry and the New Mexico drug trade.**

**Gustavo Fring:** Gustavo Fring, while superficially associated with the Cartel, hated every high-ranking member: Eladio Vuente, Juan Bolsa, and especially Hector Salamanca. Ever since Hector Salamanca killed Maximino Archiniega, Gustavo Fring slowly destroyed the Cartel. First, he urged Michael Ehrmantraut to continue robbing Hector Salamanca's trucks, cutting his business, which ultimately gave Hector Salamanca a stroke. Later, he ordered the failed assassination of Eduardo Salamanca, and then he killed Eduardo Salamanca in his methamphetamine lab. He ordered Marco and Leonel Salamanca to kill Henry Schrader, only to inform Henry Schrader of the attack. Not only did this cause the deaths of Marco and Leonel Salamanca, it also caused Juan Bolsa to die after unwanted attention from federales. During the events of ""Salud"", Gustavo Fring gave poisoned tequila to almost every remaining member of the Cartel, causing Hector Salamanca to be the only Cartel boss left. Gustavo Fring ultimately died with Hector Salamanca in a suicide bombing. Throughout both shows, Gustavo Fring was motivated by revenge. **Gustavo Fring's revenge caused him to destroy the Cartel, permanently damaging the New Mexico drug trade.**","Walter White, Saul Goodman, and Gustavo Fring as destructive agents"

2350,breakingbad,,Does anyone have a gif of this scene ?
2351,breakingbad,"Before I began watching the series, there was a few moments I already knew about, by watching clips on YouTube to see if it would be interesting:

* the ""this is not meth"" scene
* the planes crashing (I don't know the context, just that two planes crash)
* the ""you're using the wrong matches"" scene
* the scene where Hank finds out he's Heisenberg and he says ""tread lightly""
* Hank gets killed
* the scene where Pinkman says ""say you want this"" ""then do it yourself""
* the scene where his son is on the phone and says ""you killed Hank, just die already""
* the scene at the end where he's dying on the ground with Badfinger as the music (the final moments)

Other than those, I don't know anything else. But a lot of these scenes I do know take place at the very end of the series, and some are big spoilers (Hank dies, Walter dies, etc.). I'm just wondering if this gives away too much about the story.

I'm at the beginning of season 2 right now.","Did I spoil enough to ""ruin"" the series?"
2352,breakingbad,,That‚Äôs a good beer!
2353,breakingbad,"I feel like in the writing sense there are 2 major reasons why Mike wasn‚Äôt in the S4 finale. 



1 obvious reason being that Vince Gilligan wanted Mike to be in S5 and if he were with Gus in the finale then he‚Äôd probably die, so there‚Äôs that. 





But more importantly is 2, and it‚Äôs that Mike is so badass that Walt and Jesse wouldn‚Äôt have succeeded with killing Gus. So it does make you wonder how it would‚Äôve gone down if Mike had been present. 




It‚Äôs clear as day that everyone on Gus‚Äô team are just your typical henchmen. Tyrus and Victor (I know he‚Äôs dead by this point but still) were efficient and best of all loyal, they never second questioned their boss. But that‚Äôs the thing about Gus‚Äô henchmen, they never really gave their own thoughts rather just went by Gus‚Äô orders.




Mike on the other hand, always gives his input and tries to really reason with Gus when he thinks something is off, such as Mike vouching for Jesse when Gus still saw no potential in him. 





So the moment when Gus threatens Walt and his family, Mike will definitely know Walt will be up to something. Mike would‚Äôve been that reminder to Gus to be extra smart and careful, like he could‚Äôve maybe convinced Gus that Hector would never rat and something is off.




What do you think?",How do you think Mike being in the S4 finale would‚Äôve went down?

Doing my first rewatch since the show (and BCS) ended, I had completely forgotten that the blue meth is introduced almost as a throw away at the end of season 1 finale.  Walt is meeting Tuco for a re-up and hands over the blue meth.  It's rather ""uncinematic"" in that you'd think such a symbol for the show would have had a big reveal, or at least would be handled with some reverence -- instead, it's almost handled as a throw away item and immediately overshadowed by Tuco beating his henchman.  Knowing Vince, you'd almost expect some long (but artfully well done) drawn out scene with no dialogue where the meth is being made from an interesting POV and comes out blue surprisingly.

2365,breakingbad,"The post about the scene at the end of Madrigal where Skyler is arguably at her worst (i.e. most terrified of Walt) brought to mind the sharp contrast to Skylerin the previous episode, S5E1 - Live Free or Die. The moment below is one of my favorite for Skyler. It's when she goes to see Ted in the hospital, right after learning that he'd been injured (last season) in an accident with Saul's henchmen.

On the left is Skyler as she walks into Ted's room and sees him. She's feeling afraid and remorseful and apologetic, ready to beg Ted's forgiveness and beg him not to tell the police anything. But Ted speaks first and it's clear that he's TERRIFIED of Skyler. He's concluded that he vastly underestimated her. She's no pushover, she's a stone-cold killer who can send men to his door to make her instructions a reality. And he begs her to spare him. Says he has a family, that he'll never speak a word of this. He's truly groveling.

And it's like a switch flips in Skyler. On the right she's responding to his swearing never to tell anyone with one word. ""Good"". She's determination personified.

It always seems like this is a microcosm of what's been driving Walt all along. That he used to be someone people walked all over. A meek man. But since becoming Heisenberg he's a man to be feared. From blowing up the douchebag's car at the gas station, busting the knee of the boys taunting Walt, Jr. or his ill-received ""I am the one who knocks"" speech. Walt likes being feared. And clearly so does Skyler in this moment.

2398,breakingbad,"On my 5th rewatch of BB now and this time around something just didn't add up. Gus is known for being clean cut guy who only works with elite business professionals. The thing that isn't sitting right with me is why he had such a close connection with those two low level street dealers who killed Tomas. That specific killing was such a major turning point in the series between Gus, Walter, and Jesse. When you're at the top of the game manufacturing and distributing to other major international players you're not worried about two random street dealers. Just seems like too much unnecessary risk to be involved with those two especially for Gustavos standards. Had Gus never been involved and asked Jesse not to kill them the plot of the series would have been drastically different. It just seemed so forced and really doesn't make sense. At no other point in the series did we see Gus associate with any other street level desense.

What also doesn't make sense is when Gus and Walter first started working together Hank showed a map of where the blue meth was being found and New Mexico specifically wasn't marked on the map. Think they also said something along the lines of ""Don't shit where you eat"" yet those two corner dealers were pushing his product in New Mexico. Again just doesn't make sense.",Flaws with the plot

Walt: He is a reckless, egomaniac piece of shit. He manipulates people around him and himself by thinking his motive is to provide for the family. When in reality he strives for power, control and egoistic goals.

Skyler: I remember absolutely hating her character in my first watch from the very beginning on. However, I don't if it's because of the rewatch and having a much clearer picture of the personality of each character, or whether I just grew older. I can 100% understand her frustration, confusion and sentiments towards Walt. Despite the happy birthday scene, there's nothing to hate about her.

Marie: Nothing changed, lol. Annoying as fuck.

Jane: Even though I remembered her that way, she's not Jesse's holy savior by a long shot. In fact, she comes across quite manipulative and sees Jesse as a means to an end, i.e. money and drugs. I don't think she loves Jessie nearly as much as I thoguht she would when watching for the first time. Again, probably a result of myself growing older.

2492,breakingbad,"I realize this has been acknowledged before, but I didn't see that until after I had compiled this list, so I'm posting it anyway.

Rewatching Breaking Bad for the first time and I realized that a surprising number of characters are bald. I have documented all of the bald characters. I came up with 28 individuals. According to IMDB, there are a total of 421 cast members, which means that approximately 6.66% of the cast are bald.

Do we think this is a coincidence? Is there a greater meaning?

Let me know if I missed anybody and I'll adjust the calculations as necessary.
